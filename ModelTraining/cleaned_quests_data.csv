boar inn. continue with the quest marker, enter the inn, and speak withbill, who is standing by the bar. bill will introduce you tobill jr., a mounted crossbow, and give you some details of his past, after which the dialogue will end. proceed up the stairs and speak withellamaria. the queen will explain her fears ofzemouregalobtaining the ""ancient weapon"", and a plan is made to send an expedition to ungael. ellamaria asks you to assemble the fort staff, and to pay special attention toaster, who has been behaving strangely and was last seen neardraynor manor. after finishing talking to ellamaria, go south-west of thevarrock lodestonetowards draynor manor. you will find another quest instance icon near the bridge over the river. clicking it will open an instance with aster standing along the shore of theriver lum, directly south, while crying adjacent to awooden headstone. after a short dialogue sequence, aster will leave to the fort and drop amysterious letteron the

docked at the fort'sgrove. equip for combat against multiple mid-to-high-level enemies. it is recommended to have an emergencyteleport, combatpotions, andfood. it is also recommended to have fullprayerpoints. once you are well prepared, go to the grove and locate the rowboat next to the cabin. by interacting with it, you will be able to travel to ungael. a cutscene will appear in whichzemouregaltalks about the search for the ancient weapon. as soon as you arrive on the island, your party will be ambushed by severalmonsters. first, threezombie warriorsattack, shortly followed by two additional zombie warriors and askeleton knight, and finally yet another zombie warrior and skeleton knight. the other members of your party will help you defeat them. after a short fight, you make a plan to travel to a tower at the top of the island. go north and enter theruins entrance. advance north through the ruins until you reach thetower entrance. during the following fight you have the ability to commandthe raptor,aster, andbill. each fighter has a passive ability, and can be directed by using the ""target"" option on themonsters. should any of them be defeated they will revive upon starting the next wave. you can teleport out during this fight, but doing so will result in restarting from the first wave. the monsters will aggro on the nearest possible target upon spawning, so lower-levelled players may want to stay away from the middle to ensure that only a few enemies will aggro. they will also change targets to you if they are in combat with one of your allies and you attack them, so don't take on additional enemies unless you feel confident, as the enemies can hit quite hard and will use all forms of combat. the passive abilities are as follows: after entering the tower, a cutscene will play showing zemouregal attempting to reanimatevorkathusing necrotic energy. he conjures severalzombie warriorsandskeleton knightswhich attack the party and start combat. the combat is broken into the following 12 waves. between each wave, the player has time to pause as the next wave does not start until interacting with thenecrotic energyin the middle of the arena. additionally, at the beginning of the odd-numbered waves you will have the ability to choose a power-up for subsequent waves from three options chosen randomly from the following list. the power-ups offered for selection are determined before opening the interface, so re-opening it during the same wave won't change the selection. in addition to themonsterslisted below, killingunstable zombiesalways spawns threenecrotic slime. having thepersistent ragerelic power harnessed allows you to castregenerateto heal up between waves. alternatively, it is also possible torestbetween the waves to heal in case the relic isn't unlocked yet. a cannon can be used to deal extra damage and speed up rounds but as this will draw aggression of themonsters, care must be taken to not get killed. after killing all 12 waves ofmonsters, despite your best efforts to interrupt zemouregal's ritual, he will be successful in revivingvorkathand destroys your ship. your party will reconvene at the entrance to the tower. after a dialogue between the party members, in whichasterregrets their sister's decisions, look for a nearbydoorwayto interact with. follow the short path to an archive with arunic projector. interact with the projector, and aster will tell you that it appears to be in near perfect condition, but needs magical energy to work. you must find and catch threemotes of energy, which will power the projector. one of the motes of energy will be just outside the archive, while the remaining two must be revealed by searching thebookcaseandruined pillarin the archive, respectively. once powered up, thearchivist, a holographic dragonkin, will appear. he speaks exclusively in thedragonkin languageand, depending on the quests you have completed, you may be able to understand him directly. in any case, aster will be able to translate the conversation for the party. the archivist reveals that he was created byzorgoth, once the elder of thedactyl, who used the island to develop the ""perfect living weapon"", designed to eradicate humanity. this ""ancient weapon"", the dragon resurrected by zemouregal, was a failed experiment called vorkath. the archivist explains that vorkath was considered a failure because he was ""meek and docile"", and that unlike other experiments whose remains were sent to atombwhich, coincidentally, lies beneathfort forinthry, his remained onungaelbecause they were too large to be transported. after a brief conversation, the archivist will be able to activate a one-way conduit to the aforementioned tomb. zemouregal flees ungael with vorkath. vorkath destroys the ship you used to reach ungael. zemouregal promises to destroy fort forinthry. ask the archivist to open the conduit and themysterious devicewill be powered. interact with it and your party will be teleported to thecrypt'smap room. a brief dialogue will appear, and the party will decide to return to the fort and warn the others. return to the fort forinthrytown halland interact with thequest instance markeroutside its main entrance. talk to anyone inside, and the group will unite againstzemouregal, and conclude the dialogue. the quest will be

(by this point, at least one of the guards will have noticed you, but as long as you hide behind the crates before he arrives, you will be safe.) once the next guard stops moving, start walking toward the final guard, and immediately double back to the goblins. he will head toward the goblins, leaving you free to proceed to the ladder. do not attack any guards, even the ones that are fighting the goblins, as doing so will result in getting caught. if a guard does see you, quickly run to the goblins before he gets near you, as you will be forced to restart from the entrance to the caves should he get too near. at the bottom you find thatsigmundhaszaniktied to the tracks of the new train station. his prayer ability makes him immune from all damage types, so you need to use the ancient mace special ability to disable his prayers. fill up your adrenaline gauge to 100%, then equip the ancient mace and use the special ability (found under the constitution tab: ""favour of the war god""). alternatively, if you climb back up the rope (the guards will be gone), switch to legacy mode and come back down, the mace's special attack will be available immediately. now that his prayers are disabled you can kill him with any weapon fairly easily. he seems to have a high defence—low levels be warned. if you attempt to untie zanik whilst the fight is in progress, you will be hit for around 100life pointsof damage. if you die, your gravestone will be by the ladder in the lumbridge caves. you will have to sneak past the guards again. when he is defeated, he will teleport away. untie zanik, and watch the final cut scene to finish the quest. another slice of h.a.m. is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

though, the area must be prepared, a pest problem needs to be sorted and the ogres really ought to be reminded that bashing people with big clubs isn't a traditional health treatment. available just outside oo'glog: travel tooo'glog, directly south ofyanille, and speak tochief tess. she tells you that she cannot open her business for customers until the ""bossy lady"" at the bank in oo'glog allows her to do so. offer to help, and the chief asks you to speak withbalnea, the ""human lady"" in the ogre village's bank. balnea has promised the ogres 'shiny pretties' in exchange for letting her set up her spa in the city. enter the bank, across the path from the chief's hut, and talk to balnea. after a long dialogue filled with business-talk, balnea asks you to help turn oo'glog into a health spa. agree, and she sends you first to help the village's chef set up a spit and cooking fire. this also opens the bank in oo'glog. speak to the ogre cook,chargurr, just north of the bank. she tells you she needs a big fire with lots oflogsto cook chompy. agree to get the logs for her. give chargurr 8achey logsand 10eucalyptus logs. this has to be done in one go, so you must have 18 free spaces to carry them. the bank should be accessible viaogress bankerby this point. you will lay the logs in the pit to set up an unlit stove. speak with chargurr again and she tells you that she wants big, long spears to cook chompies on. give her fourspearsto be used as spits. talk to chargurr, and tell her you would like to give her the four spears. you hang them in the trees, over the logs. again, speak with chargurr, who now needs 2 chompy birds. fetch her the raw chompy birds and stick them on the spears. talk to her again, and now she instructs you to light the fire. do so and speak to chargurr one last time to finish the first task and setup catering services for the resort. speak to balnea in the bank. she asks you to helpsnurgh, the hotel manager in the building in the southeast corner of the village. speak to snurgh, who informs you that the pillows in the hotel are made of raw meat, the softest thing that she could find. advise her to use feathers instead of meat. she agrees and asks you to get her some stripy feathers. give her eightstripy feathersfromtropical wagtailsso that she can make the pillows. return to balnea for the next task. have another jargon-laced conversation withbalnea. she says your next task is to helpkringkin the hair salon just east of the bank. she asks how can she do hair with no tools. tell her you will help. take fourwolf bonesand eightlarupia fursto kringk. talk to her again, and give her the four ""wolfsie bones"" and eight ""lup-lup furses"" to complete this task. speak to balnea a fourth time. she wants you to helpseegud, who is in the hut northeast of the bank. talk toseegud. she tells you she needs to clearflying bugsfrom the fivespapools by lighting fires in the fire pits next to each pool. for each type of bug, you need to burn eucalyptus logs and a specific plant to keep the swarm away. seegud has placed stones beside each fire pit to help her remember what to burn. plant and rock combinations are different for every player, using a reference chart like below will help with the process. you will need to collect the plants from outside of oo'glog and combine them with eucalyptus logs to light the fires. go northwest from seegud, and examine the pile of stones between the saltwater spring and the fire pit. in your chat window, you see a description of the stones. place the logs and the plants that match the stones in the fire pit, and light them. you quickly notice something is not right: the bugs are still hovering over the pool and a mischievous ogre child is laughing. return to seegud, and speak with her. she says the ogre children must have mixed up the stones. you now need to discover which plants the mixed-up stones represent. talk withsnarrl, an ogre child just west of seegud and by the saltwater spring. she recommends you start with the thermal bath. head north of seegud to the thermal bath. which stones match which plants is different for each player. discover their new relationships through a process of elimination. as you learn which stone represents which plant, make a note of the match so you do not have to figure it out again (you cannot check what plant you used after the fire is lit). each combination only requires two plants and one eucalyptus log, except for the bandos pool. to begin, examine the pile of stones next to one of the pools. place the logs and one of the plants in the fire pit, and light them. if you get the message, ""the fire has a pungent aroma, but it doesn't seem to have any effect on the insects,"" add more logs and a different plant to the fire pit and light them. fresh logs are required for each attempt, otherwise you will not disperse the insects even if you find the correct combination. if you get the message, ""the pungent smell makes the insects disperse"", the combination is correct. finally, after dispersing all the bugs, speak to seegud and then return to balnea. do not throw away any of the herbs once you have finished clearing away the bugs, as you will need them in the next task. talk to balnea to learn about the ""one last outstanding matter."" she asks you to trap the creatures wandering around the village. she suggests they may not be as easy to trap as you might think and recommends you talk tochief tessto learn how to catch the creatures. talk to chief tess. she tells you that the animals in the area are clever, so you will need to be sneaky to catch them; you need to burn ""stuffs"" to lure the animals to the traps. to catch thediseased kebbits, setdeadfall trapson the boulders to the east and west of the saltwater spring; catch two from each side of the spring, as they will not follow you very far. there are 4 diseased kebbits to catch. bait the trap by usingfever grasson the deadfall trap. light another fever grass and run around to lure a kebbit to the trap. if you are having trouble luring the kebbits, try walking. the smouldering grass turns to ashes after about 30 seconds, so have a few in your inventory before starting. the smouldering method uses the main hand weapon slot, so remove any weapons you are wielding in your main hand before starting. diseased kebbits become aggressive if you burntansymumnearby them. also, if you try to set more than one trap at once, an ogre child scolds you: ""hey, you, human! you no allowed to clutter up oo'glog wiv traps. you only set one at a time here."" to clear oo'glog of thewimpy birds, set abird snarein the area west of the bank. light atansymumflower and run around to attract the birds to the snare. there are 5 wimpy birds to catch. wimpy birds are repelled if you burnfever grass. burninglavenderwill make them peck you. this part may behave oddly, with the final wimpy bird to be caught refusing to follow the player and unrelated wimpy birds appearing in the bird snare. to fix this, the player may need to ask chief tess how to catch wimpy birds again, being sure to end the dialogue with the ""nothing else to ask."" option instead of simply walking away. rid oo'glog of theplatypodesby laying abox trapand then burninglavenderin the area west of chief tess, by the sulphur spring. platypodes have poison spurs. do not burnfever grassas it may cause them to attack with their ""webbed feet of doom"". once you catch one, check the shaking box to put the platypus in your inventory. after you have caught the whole family (patrick,peanut,penelope, andpeter), go to the northeast corner of the village, by the coast within oo'glog (see the ""baby platypus"" part in the map above), and release the platypodes near the bulrushes. each released platypus gives you acasketor anoyster. once you have caught all the creatures, return to balnea one last time (you must dismiss any active follower). you then see acutsceneof the grand opening of the spa and thewise old mantaking the waters. congratulations, quest complete! as a first resort is not currently required for any quests or

castlejust north of thelodestone. upon arriving at the council meeting, azzanadra will pull you over to the side, already talking with botharmadylandicthlarin. the council seren has assembled is fully under her control now due to her powers, much to his disappointment. he tells you that it is not the adult elder gods who endanger gielinor, but instead, their offspring. armadyl and icthlarin will refuse to assist azzanadra, but because of your role as the world guardian, asks you to help. you accept, and he tells you to meet him atkharid-et dig site. once you arrive, head inside the main fortress to thepraetorium war table. do not enter it; next to the tabletrindinewill already be talking with azzanadra, who tells you that there are most likely only three elder god eggs on gielinor; those ofwen,bikandful, asmahnever made it to gielinor andjassacrificed hers to create thestone of jas. he tells you to meet him at theworld gate. bringenhanced excaliburor food due to the toxic

the world gate and speak to azzanadra. travel throughthe approach, talking to azzanadra at different stops which are considered rest stops to avoid life point loss. if you must leave freneskae, talk again to azzanadra at the world gate for the quest; using the world gate to travel to freneskae directly will not return you to the quest. getting to the end of the approach will take you directly to the elder halls.  after entering the elder halls, azzanadra will realise that someone else is inside. the person is none other thanariane, who is shocked to see you and azzanadra. she tells you that after killingxenia, she began having visions and realised that the elder gods' eggs were the threat to gielinor, lining up with azzanadra's analysis. you will then be asked to inspect all five shell fragments at the end of the halls. after doing so, the three of you quickly realise that this route is going nowhere. azzanadra then recalls ablank observationand suggests you drain the nearby wisps found in the halls to charge it. harvest 50 memories from each of the four wisps, then combine the memories with the blank observation, which will absorb the memories, creating acharged observation. talk to azzanadra. azzanadra will attempt to look at the memories, but fails. ariane then asks to do so and senses a similar vision to what she had previously experienced. a vision unfolds of a perfect world freneskae which was created by the previous cycle of the elder gods, and where a next generation of eggs were hatched. each elder god, sensing the impending hatching of their egg, imparted their memories and identity by touching their egg before it hatched. upon hatching, the hatchlings drained all anima from the planet in mere minutes before moving across the universe. realising that the eggs could be prevented from hatching if the elder gods could be stopped from touching them and transferring their identities, azzanadra sets in motion a plan that may possibly stop the destruction of the world. azzanadra tells you that he has senttrindineto falador in order to getsaradomin's aid, hoping that his crown will be able to find the location of the current eggs on gielinor. he will then depart with ariane for kharid-et dig site. once ariane and azzanadra leave, the player begins to hear a shadow voice and a light voice arguing in their head. go through the options until the player says they have had enough and leaves for falador to talk to trindine. the elder god eggs, about to hatch. the eggs hatch, draining every nearby living thing of life. freneskae is drained of all life, becoming a desolate husk. gielinor. upon arriving at thewhite knights' castle, meet withsir upticious, who is actually trindine in disguise. she suggests you head to saradomin's throne room to look for clues. the throne room can be accessed from a set of stairs on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us](behind the desk whichsir renitee, falador's chief herald sits). saradomin is not present; speak tofather frith, who tells you that saradomin is travelling across the universe to spread his faith. although you tell him you need to speak urgently with him, he tells you that there's a visitingtemple knighton the ground floor's war table, who issir owen. sir owen has managed to keep his corruption under control, but is upset at how thewhite knightsare treating the threat of the elder gods as trivial. you, owen, and upticious will then confront frith at the throne room. frith will suggest to owen to voice his concerns withsir amik varze, since he is the owner of the castle. you can either tell amik that the council is moving too slowly or lie and say that it sent you; the choice does not matter. amik will assist as long aspadomenesis content with the new recruits. after talking with amik, owen will pull you and upticious to the side, voicing his frustration once more and stating that the temple knights are better than the white knights, as they actually do good since their head,sir vey lance, takes orders directly from saradomin himself. talk with padomenes in the courtyard, who tells the three of you that the recruits are poorly equipped assir vyvinrefuses to arm them properly. speak with sir vyvin, who tells you that he will not give them new equipment until saradomin blesses them. talk with sir owen downstairs, then search the nearby cupboard. fed up with the incompetence of the white knights, owen decides to take the matter into his own hands and tells you to meet him at the war room once more (located in the eastern castle, on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]). after finding nothing except saint elsbeth's birthday, owen realises that the documents must be in a safe in sir renitee's office. you will automatically take the document out from the safe. the document reads as follow: in his eternal wisdom the great saradomin has provided these instructions should he need to return to gielinor. firstly one must remove any unexpected items from saradomin's throne, and scatter the anointed incences, for this will be his guiding beacon. secondly, one must prepare a blessed silent bell. to do this one must remove the clapper from a standard slayer bell and then bless it in the well at the temple in paterdomus. finally, one must ring the bell thrice whilst standing by the throne and calling out the name of the most holy. owen is informed by sir upticious that she is the mahjarrat recently released from kharid-et dig site, and he agrees to work with her. while the two prepare some of the ritual materials, they tell you to collect thesilent bellfor them. this is obtained by buying aslayer bellfrom any slayer master, then cutting the clapper with aknife. head topaterdomus, enter themausoleumunder the temple and use the silent bell on the well to bless it. after blessing the bell, return to saradomin's throne room and ring the bell three times, calling saradomin's name. saradomin will then be summoned to the throne room, asking why he has been called back. you will tell him of the threat of the elder gods; tell him in the following order: after you inform saradomin that the world is in danger, he will ask about seren. you can either tell him the truth or lie, but again the choice does not matter. saradomin will tell you that he too had tried to locate the eggs with his crown, but failed; either the eggs are shielded, or are not affected. frith will then scold the three of you for wasting saradomin's time, but saradomin will scold frith in turn for believing that the elder gods' threat is negligible. while he appreciates his faith, he tells him that he cannot rely on it alone and it has to be tempered. with no further leads, sir owen will apologise. you and trindine will instead recruit him to assist in azzanadra's efforts. return to azzanadra at kharid-et dig site's war table. azzanadra will be surprised by owen's presence, but nonetheless accepts the aid of the temple knights. as there are more unofficial ways to find information, he suggests splitting up; he and ariane will interrogate the mouthpieces once more, while owen will track sir vey lance and you and trindine will head to the tokhaar and find clues from both the wizards' tower and hall of memories.  travel to thehall of memoriesand head inside. upon detecting trindine's presence,the archivistwill attempt to initiate defensive protocols. attempt to distract it by selecting any one of the three responses three times; the choices do not matter. you will stop it from doing so by dumping its core memories, after which you will tell it that you are searching for memories of the elder gods. the archivist will request that you restore its dumped memories first, to which you command it to flag trindine as a non-intruder in response. collect sixarchivist's memoriesfloating around and return to the archivist, who is recharging. after it recharges, you will request information about the elder god eggs. it will then release sixrestricted memoriesand tell you that only the world guardian may use it. collect and place them on the plinths, three on each side, near the unstable rift. inspect the memory bud to find arestricted engram, and go through the pool and use it on the fountain of energy up above. the memory reveals thatguthixwas aware of the threat of the elder gods and even planned his own death to prepare for their impending arrival. however, there is no mention of where the eggs are. speak to trindine on the surface ofkaramja volcano, just outside the entrance to thetzhaar city, and then proceed to enter the city. upon entering, you will be met by a ga'al, who reveals itself to betzhaar-ga'al-kot, and who is initially scared of trindine due to her shadow presence. it then tells you that the tokhaar are at the main plaza. the tokhaar is none other thantokhaar-hok, who has sensed his masters' return. with most of the haar-tok and tokkul returned, he tells the remaining tzhaar to return.tzhaar-mej-jehrefuses to comply, whiletzhaar-xil-togdecides to return to the lava. trindine and tzhaar-ga'al-kot head to the library, which is north-west of the main plaza. it is accessible down a tunnel on the western wall of the cul-de-sac north of the fairy ringblp. tokhaar-hok refuses to tell you of the location of gielinor's elder halls as you are not worthy to enter them. go into the library west of the plaza and talk to trindine and tzhaar-ga'al-kot, who are unable to assist further as reading the orbs will take too long. meet with trindine at the entrance, who has disguised herself aswizard trindy.wizard valinawill be concerned about trindy as she is not a member of the order, but after you tell her of the elder gods and vouch for her, allows the two of you to browse their library. trindine will search the eastern shelves while tasking you to search the western ones. however, all of the books the two of you find are completely irrelevant. speak to wizard trindy, and then return to kharid-et dig site. upon returning to thepraetorium war table, ariane is knocked out cold on the floor. azzanadra reveals that their visit was mostly fruitless, so they simply destroyed the mouthpieces and ariane absorbed the energy, as part of her plan. after telling azzanadra of your attempts, ariane regains consciousness and tells everyone that the eggs are in theheart of gielinor. you, azzanadra, and ariane will go there, while azzanadra has trindine search for owen. speak to azzanadra near the entrance, where he reveals that the only remaining forces inside are justgregorovicalong withhelwyrand his elves. enter the heart, where helwyr will refuse to let the three of you through. gregorovic then appears, having heard his ""master's"" call and goads helwyr and his elves into chasing him. ariane will then open the entrance to gielinor's elder halls. go observe wen's, bik's, and ful's eggs down each passage. azzanadra will then leave to discuss the matter with zaros, upon which voices in the player's head suggest to you that trindine wasn't telling you everything. return to kharid-et dig site with the blank observation. upon returning, trindine is nowhere to be seen, but traces of her anima are leaking. approach the praetorian war table, then approach a pylon to get struck by some dark anima, and then head to fourshadow anchorsto power them up. simply going near any of the aforementioned objects suffices. you will then entershadow realmand five oftrindine wispswill appear - collect 50memories(the wisps becometrindine springs) and then inspect theblank observation. the memory reveals that trindine was intending to steal something. you decide to return to all three places you visited earlier. in tzhaar city, back at the main plaza, tzhaar-ga'al-kot will tell you she was asking about information on the elder artefacts, particularly the locator, and how to use it. in the wizards' tower, speak to wizard valina, and she will tell you trindine stole a book known as ""the cartalian heresy"", which investigates a legend involving saradomin's crown, and how he allegedly loses his power if he is separated from it. finally, in the hall of memories, the archivist will tell you that trindine accessed a memory labelled ""the elder crown"", which was subsequently erased. you will quickly realise that trindine is interested in the locator, or saradomin's crown. return to ariane at gielinor's elder halls in the heart of gielinor. if you usedthe heart teleport, you will need to exit and re-enter the heart. give her the blank observation, which will cause her to show you a memory.sir vey lanceis actually the demonveiliniusin disguise, and almost all of the temple knights are unknowingly followers ofzaros. owen becomes shocked by the turn of events and threatens to expose them, but trindine knocks him out. trindine then informs veilinius to continue the plan as expected. make sure to talk to ariane before teleporting out or she will not appear in front of the castle. return to falador and speak to ariane at the entrance of the castle. a cutscene occurs with saradomin returning to inspect his knights. you have the option of warning saradomin of the zarosian plot or remaining silent. regardless, the frostenhorn blows, affecting the nearby knights with zaros's aura, and the temple knights engage the white knights as azzanadra sheds his disguise and takes the crown from saradomin. saradomin then forces the crown back to him, but before the situation escalates, zaros appears and reclaims it, stating that it was never saradomin's to begin with, and that he had simply ""entrusted"" it to him and states that he has no intention of disrupting his rule before he leaves. the majority of the temple knights and some of the white knights are teleported out. saradomin will spot you and ask if you had a role in what had just happened. after telling him otherwise, he will allow you to leave. the incident has left you shaken and you decide to confront the zarosians regarding the incident. return to kharid-et dig site once more and head to the praetorium war table. zaros will begin planning to attack themysterious monolith, something which will get him into conflict withserenas he teleports away to finish preparations. azzanadra will apologise to you for the deception, as your loyalties are too shifting for zaros' plans. while he appreciated your assistance and company, he tells you to bear no grudge as the next time they will meet, it will be as enemies, much to your surprise as he teleports out. trindine then tells you that she returned the book and forgot about sir owen, but reassures you that he is fine before teleporting away. ariane will remain by the table, having declined to join the zarosians as she wishes to live free and says she doesn't need to follow a higher being to give her life meaning. she advises you to avoid visiting gielinor's elder halls to prevent unnecessary attention, as she looks to create a research team to study the eggs. congratulations, quest complete! azzanadra's quest is directly required for the

you can use the cart of hajedy to get to shilo village very quickly. hajedy is located only a few steps east of garth. teleporting to the al kharid lodestone and using the glider if you are able is also a quick way to travel to the maze. you cannot take a familiar with you into the maze. there is a bank in shilo village. given that the maze is loaded with aggressive monsters, take decent armour, food and anti-poison. asuper defence potionis recommended as well. the alternative to food, armour and anti-poisons is to take a few prayer potions, equipment with prayer bonus and aprayer bookwith aholy symbolto cure from poison. with this method, the protection from melee prayer (level 43 prayer required) will halve damage, except the damage taken from failing obstacles and occasional poisoning. the quickest way to the maze is to use either the wicked hood teleport to the nature altar or by using the karamja lodestone (assuming you have activated it), then run southeast. if you do not have access to either of those options, follow these instructions (refer to the picture for more help on getting to the maze): from theshilo villageexit, go east and jump on the stepping stones. go far north past the maze to a log, cross it, and go south again. an alternative path is to walk around shilo and go east along the northern fence of shilo. try to find an endpoint of a vine to climb onto on the north-west corner of the maze. the 'climb-on' vine point forms the maze entry. as the maze is fairly close to the nature runecrafting altar, all paths to the maze are fairly similar to the nature runecrafting trips. you can also use thefairy ringcodeckrkaramja: south oftai bwo wannaivillageshilo villageand run straight east past the nature altar, or aspirit graahkto teleport you (57 summoning required). the fastest way is to use the wicked hood's teleport to the nature altar. this is usually the fastest way to the maze, unless you used hajedy's cart to get to shilo village. in the maze are many creatures, some aggressive, some poisonous. players should bringanti-poison potionsand food. the maze has a number of navigational options: tip:scars on vines can help players to find their way through the vine maze. the end of the maze features the vine root. it can be obtained by finding the patches of loose soil, where right clicking will show ""dig loose soil"", which is used to expose the vine root. then a new option will appear to allow cutting the root. use the root cutting on the plant pot. with a bit of luck it will grow. if the cutting does not grow, dig up and cut another root in a different soil spot. there are five spots to dig in (two northeast of the trunk, one north of the trunk, one west of the trunk, and one off in the corner to the southwest of the trunk), and only one of those five spots will yield the root that will grow. use the root cutting with the plant pot filled with soil. if it fails to grow you will retain the plant pot with soil. when the vine root cutting successfully grows, use your plant pot on your normal pot to end up with asealed pot. that pot now contains the root. be careful not to teleport until the root has grown and has been sealed in the pot. if the sealed pot is lost, talk to garth to get another. go back to ardougne, and talk to horacio. bring the root cutting sealed in the pot. the player must plant the vine in horacio's vine patch, found northeast of horacio with a gardening trowel. atool leprechaunis nearby, for obtaining farming tools if you already stored them. after planting the vine, a cutscene appears where thejade vinehas grown out of control. horacio now insists that the vine needs to be killed. fortunately, there is an opportunity to prepare for the battle. a guard dog barks at the jade vine... ...only to be hit with one of the vines attacks. the dog then flees. the vine binds horacio, so he will not help you with the battle. killing the wild jade vine with necromancy bugs the quest, a melee weapon is required. thewild jade vineuses all three combat styles so you cannot fully protect yourself with prayer, however its magic attack is much weaker and used less often than its melee attack. therefore it is recommended to get magic defence, and then protect from melee. the vine's magic attack will poison for 70 damage (regardless of if it hits), so a dose of asuper antipoisoncan be used to defend against it. the ranged attack is not a serious threat but it is recommend to still keep your health up as it occasionally hits up to 1000. the vine can only be damaged by a hatchet; a melee weapon can be used if the hatchet is on the tool belt. it is recommended that you do not use aprayer book. it will drain your prayer each time you use it, and the vine poisons quite frequently, causing you to waste a lot of your much needed prayer points. if you need to leave, you can exit through the arch, but you will have to start the battle over again. 
after killing the vine, cut the last remainder of it using your secateurs. now talk once more to horacio to complete the quest. back to my roots is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

kill the undead giant, ignoring the other undead if possible. alternatively, you can let the raptor kill the giant without engaging yourself staying near the fort walls as a safe zone, or only engage with the other monsters guarding the place of power to save supplies. once the giant is killed, the player must disrupt the place of power. the players may refer to thestrategies for zemouregal & vorkathfor another view of the encounter. you will start from the northern camp and then move anticlockwise to the north-western and finally the western camp. once the western place of power is disrupted, a cutscene will ensue where zemouregal and vorkath will personally attack, destroying the western walls and the workshop. the loading screens shown at this moment may cover this cutscene. head to the centre of the new arena to triggerzemouregalandvorkathto spawn.the raptorwill assist you for the fight. vorkath will have 375,000 health and zemouregal will have 125,000 health. the majority of the damage incurred from the fight will primarily come from zemouregal's attacks. vorkath will attack withmagicwhile zemouregal attacks withnecromancy. focus on vorkath, taking note of its attacks. antifire protection is recommended as it mitigates a significant amount of vorkath's dragonfire damage (which can also be blocked by any damage-nullifying abilities or spells likedisruption shield). the fight will have three phases; two phases with vorkath and zemouregal, and the last one with only zemouregal. as allplaces of powersare disrupted in this fight, zemouregal will not be able to call undead or use bone spikes against the player. zemouregal is immune to damage during the first phase, which is dropped to a ~90% damage reduction the next two phases. at the end of the first two phases, vorkath will turn on zemouregal. after the second instance followed by twoauto-attacks, vorkath will fly away to prepare an arena-wide magic attack. using theextra action buttonwhen this occurs will cancel the incoming attack and deal damage to vorkath. it is important to time this button correctly as using it too early or late will result in massive damage. zemouregal's damage reduction will be temporarily lifted while vorkath is away. it is possible to defeat zemouregal before vorkath flies back, which will end the fight prematurely. at this point, if the player's damage is lacking, it is especially important to keep health high as zemouregal will begin using more damaging abilities such asfinger of deathanddeath skulls, which are likely to be overlooked as the player is likely to be focused on vorkath. if vorkath returns before zemouregal's health is depleted, players should deplete all of vorkath's health first, who will then fly away. then deplete all of zemouregal's health to end the encounter. return to thefortand speak tothe raptor, who wants the staff gathered in thetown hall. you need to locate and talk to five different groups of characters around the fort to ask them to move to the town hall. guard captain sofía promises to give her fallen guards a proper send-off, while the others commend you for your glorious victory against the duo;zemouregalis also being held captive in theprisonunderneath thecommand centre. once everyone is gathered in the town hall, speak to the raptor again, who states that the fortifications need to be rebuilt. speak to bill, who has repair materials stashed behind the kitchen. you are tasked to repair thefort wall,fort tower, and thegateswith the emergency stone supply; the fort guards will be handling theworkshop. you will need fourstone wall segmentspicked from thepile of stoneeast of thekitchento make all the repairs. the repairs are performed at therepair hotspotsin the north-western corner of the fort. after having repaired all four fortifications, talk to aster, overseer siv, or rodney to initiate the feast, where you thank the entire staff for their valiant efforts against zemouregal and vorkath. asterwill ask you to check in onthe raptorafter the feast. talk to them, and they will tell you to talk tozemouregalas you will need to make sure he is kept contained. head east of thecommand centreand go down thefloor hatchand talk to zemouregal; you may choose to gloat or say nothing. zemouregal will spew threats and nearly revealsmoia's plan, but realises the same and stops shy of doing so. you will then strengthen the cell with necromantic wards to ensure he doesn't try to escape. back atzamorak's hideout, aforgotten warriorinforms moia that zemouregal's attack failed and he surrendered rather than risk death. moia will be unsurprised that he tried to save his own life, but then reminds herself that themahjarratare low in numbers and such needless death should be avoided. she then addressesbilrach, who has a strange purple aura around him and is subservient to her. finishing the cutscene and claiming the rewards completes the quest. zemouregal imprisoned beneath the command centre bilrach is revealed to still be alive, surrounded by mysterious purple energy. battle of forinthry is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: popup following the game update that added the quest login screen vorkath concept art vorkath variant exploration concept art vorkath angles and materials concept art vorkath animations and attacks concept art"

this helps in determining where to place your allies before starting. the three or four allies are able to win the battle without the player actively participating in combat, and doing so will reduce the risk of death during first and second battles. however, the player can gain experience during the first three waves if they contribute to defeating an enemy. the enemies only consist of the weaktemple knightsand slightly strongerabyssal prowlers, who appear on the final wave. the enemies spawn from the gate leading to thekharidian desertin the south-west and at the bridge leading to thepolypore dungeonin the south-east, and attack the barricade defences leading to themysterious monolithin the north. the knights have 10,000 health and can use abilities, while the prowlers have 35,000 health but only attack the barricade. while all three allies are powerful themselves, it is recommended to place all of them near the barricade. helwyr is the strongest of the trio, with his bleed and mushroom poison attacks quickly decimating all enemies in reach; when paired with zilyana, they can easily kill any enemy that attempts to attack the barricade. thaerisk is a ranged fighter and can be placed further away to soften up incoming enemies, with his attacks ricocheting to a secondary target if one is nearby the primary one. if all three are near the barricade, then the target settings (closest, furthest away, strongest, weakest) do not need to be set. west of helwyr in front of the tree of balance is a separate brief battle between saradomin and nex. see the transcript section for their dialogue. during this battle, the bank inside the exam centre is available for use. the following section of the quest was made available at the beginning of1 june2021. talk to ali the wise. he will believe that the fighting will end soon as the zarosians are evenly matched, but realises he has spoken too soon. the zarosians, includingazzanadra,char,nex, and threetemple knightswill be outside themysterious monolith(codex) wherezaroswill teleport in, having been forced to intervene once more. he states that gielinor is a lost cause and will leave, but believes that he can find what he seeks on the other side -erebus, having the necessary tools to guide him through and protect him.serenwill teleport in and implores that they work together, but zaros refuses, as the elder gods are different from them. the only way he will be stopped is if she kills him, but seren refuses to do so and teleports away. zaros reveals that the codex was not initially used to store information, but instead to seal up patches of the shadow realm which would endanger gielinor if left unchecked. azzanadra asks zaros if he may accompany him to erebus, but zaros declines, stating that the atmosphere there will kill him. azzanadra then offers to prepare the world for his return. as zaros opens up the codex and enters,shadow cacklersbegin leaking from the codex. saradomin becomes alarmed by this and orders the alliance to repel the otherworldly monsters. azzanadra offers aid, which saradomin initially refuses as the zarosians had caused the problem, but azzanadra points out that the shadow monsters are too powerful to handle. saradomin will begrudgingly accept azzanadra's ceasefire. he tells you that he will leave the forces at your command, along with the zarosians, to protect the northern and southern barriers while he and azzanadra try to handle the situation. this time the barricades are set up to prevent the cacklers leaving the monolith from reaching the rest of gielinor. nex will join alongside thaerisk, helwyr and zilyana. all waves include shadow cacklers, level 107 monsters with 14,000 health. they are weak to slashing attacks. waves 2 and 3 will begin addingelite variants, which are level 111 with 24,000 health. elite variants are indicated with a dark shadow ball behind them. the cacklers attack with melee, but will only attack the player if they don't sense a barricade nearby. all three waves target the southern barricade, with the northern one becoming a target in waves 2 and 3. in wave 3, some of the cacklers will take a faster path to the northern barrier. one possible setup is to place helwyr and zilyana at the northern barricade, right next to the barricade so that they can hit enemies that may make it all the way to the barricade, and move nex and thaerisk to the southern barricade. this setup will not need you to move anyone during the battle and allows you to do whatever you please in the area without participating in the battle any further. sometimes helwyr or zilyana will not be able to attack if they are placed between the barricades as the monsters will end up underneath them, so make sure you place them next to the barricade and not between the barricades. the simplest strategy may be tocheesethe tower defence minigame by stacking units that do area damage (such as helwyr) on top of the monolith (codex) steps. leave or move melee units at the barricade, or either clean up stragglers on your own that escape. during this battle, the bank chests inside theexam centreand next to thearchaeologist's workbenchare available for use. the following section of the quest was made available at the beginning of7 june2021. talk to ali the wise orwizard trindy. trindine will inform you that the shadow cacklers are too powerful for the alliance; they can't push them back behind the codex, and the harmful shadow anima it is spewing out is weakening some of them before they can even fight. she can also sense larger, more dangerous beings waiting for their chance beyond the codex, and asks you who to call on for reinforcements. suggest thetokhaar, as they areful's creations, and seeing the danger the shadow creatures pose will rouse them to defend their greatest work. head to thefight kiln's entrance and select the monolith option upon interacting with it. upon approachingtokhaar-hok, he will notice that you smell of anathema and asks what you have done. you will tell him that it wasn't your fault and inform him of the situation at the monolith. hok will not appear to respond to help, stating that he is looking into the protocols that the masters had given him in such an emergency. return to the archaeology campus and speak to ali the wise. a cutscene will begin in which the tokhaar have joined to repel the shadow invaders. saradomin will inform you that the shadow creatures have broken through the initial defences and are now trying to attack an enclosure east ofgower farmin which the injured are recuperating, along with the eastern gates ofvarrock. alongside the previous defenders,tokhaar-hokand onetokhaar-mejandtokhaar-xilwill join the battle. all three waves target the north barricade of the enclosure in the easterngower farm, with the eastern gates ofvarrockbecoming a target in waves 2 and 3 and the southern barricade of the enclosure becoming a target in wave 3. as with before, the monsters spawn from the codex and players can shift their aggression towards them for a majority of the battle by attacking them before they can leave the walkway. some enemies may spawn out of bounds, but will automatically teleport outside to the surrounding area and cannot be provoked into attacking the player. tokhaar-hok can deal strong double blows to the enemies, tokhaar-mej's attacks can bind them in place, and tokhaar-xil's attacks ricochet to multiple targets. one possible setup is to place helwyr and zilyana at the north and south barricades of the gower farm enclosure, with nex and thaerisk on the crossroad east of the enclosure; while tokhaar-hok, tokhaar-mej, and tokhaar-xil placed in front of the eastern gates ofvarrock. the following section of the quest was made available at the beginning of14 june2021. the alliance manages to repel the shadow invaders.char, next to the portal, blows the frostenhorn in victory, but this causes thecodexto suck her inside, tonex's horror.azzanadrais determined to close the codex, despite nex's fears that it will take him in too. azzanadra successfully closes the codex, but the backlash of energy painfully and unintentionally ascends him into a god in the process. in the aftermath of the battle, thetokhaarlook at what the surface dwellers have done. seeing that the damage done by the surface dwellers (either unaware or uncaring that zaros had caused it), they attack their former allies, intending to dismantle everything and purge the taint.ali the wiseasks azzanadra if he can still fight. azzandara is slightly dazed, but states that he can. nex is worried over char's fate, but azzanadra states that his work is done. saradominwill then come in and inform you that the tokhaar are attempting to march on the codex to destroy it, entrusting you to protect the barricades in the south, north-west, and north before teleporting out. the allies are the same as week 2 of the fight. thaerisk is north of the monolith, while the other three are scattered to the west and southern areas of the archaeology guild building. unlike theshadow cacklersin the previous battles, the tokhaar will retaliate against the player upon being struck regardless of how close they are to thebarricades. they are far stronger than theshadow cacklersand knights, and can attack from all three corners of the combat triangle. their weaknesses are the same as they are in thefight kiln: water spells for the meleers, crush for the rangers, and bolts for the mages. the damage reduction mechanic they had in the fight kiln is not carried over here. wave one starts withtokhaar-ketsandtokhaar-mejstargeting the southern barricade, and they appear from the pass toal kharid. later in the first wave they begin spawning south-west of thejolly boar innand south offort forinthry, targeting the northern barricade, andtokhaar-xilsare added to the mix. waves two and three begin targeting the north-western barricade. wave three also introducestokhaar-yt-mejkotsinto the fray. the northern spawns split up right in front ofvarrock's eastern gate. helwyr can easily handle the southern barrier for all three waves. nex and thaerisk can be placed at the crossroads outside varrock's gate to soften up incoming tokhaar, and zilyana can be placed in front of the northern barricade as it takes the most damage. the player can assist nex and thaerisk in the event that some tokhaar leak past them. alternatively, nex, thaerisk and zilyana can be placed at the crossroads outside varrock's east gate and helwyr at the southern barricade, blocking alltokhaarfrom reaching both the northern and northwestern barriers. this should require little to no player intervention. the following section of the quest was made available at the beginning of21 june2021. tokhaar-hok will call a retreat, seeing that he has lost too many of his brethren to the alliance and that they need to replenish for the fights to come. saradomin will have his forces protect the monolith, believing that they need to keep it in check if it opens again. azzanadra insists that it will remain closed. regardless, saradomin asks the zarosians to leave. speak to trindine or ali the wise to leave the scene. you may also talk to nex, azzanadra and saradomin to get some insights of the recent events from their perspective. saradomin will forgive you for bringing the tokhaar, as no one knew that they would turn in an instant. nex is upset at you for not being able to save char and vows to do so herself, with or without your aid. azzanadra is slightly upset as he was aware he was the next to ascend following zaros' ritual on freneskae, but nonetheless holds faith that he will return to gielinor once more. he also gives you ashardthat he believes you can make use of more than him. trindine and wahisietel will reveal to you that reiniger's prediction was right, and that there is an intact area of senntisten to the north. a cutscene will ensue in which the tokhaar's reason to attack their allies is shown; too much anathema from erebus leaked into gielinor, and now the three eggs in the elder halls have begun to show signs of movement, leading up to the great revision.

the wizards' tower to investigate a sunken tutorial island. speak towizard myrtleat the fountains in front of the wizards' tower. she wants to know what happened to her mentor,terrova, the magic instructor on tutorial island. however, she is afraid of water and wants to send you to investigate. talk tovannaka, who can be found by theslayer mastermap icon just south of theedgevillebank. he explains why he left tutorial island before it was flooded, and wishes to go back with the player and myrtle. return to myrtle, who is now standing beside vannaka, and they ask you to go tomudskipper point. this can easily be accessed through the fairy ring codeaiq, or by running south of theport sarimlodestone. there is a fairy ring to the south of the wizards' tower (codedis). talk to myrtle about diving down to tutorial island. there are three options you can choose from to do so: myrtle's spell, your own diving apparatus from youraquarium, or afishbowl helmetanddiving apparatus. the only difference between the three is cosmetic. you will be sent down to the island. read themessage in a bottlenear the door of the first room, finding a key in the base. you will not receive a physical key, but you will be able to go through the door. your task now is to go through tutorial island as if you were a starting player years ago to break the dark magician's curse. there are multiple rooms that involve multiple skills. walk out of the building, and shortly along the path you will findbrynna, who has been turned into acrassian-humanhybrid. talk to her about the survival skills. she will then instruct you to catch someraw shrimpswimming around. as you are underwater, you do not need any fishing nets or rods, as they can be caught with bare hands. once you get some shrimp in your inventory, cook them on the steam vent by the dead tree to createboiled shrimp. talk to brynna again, and she expresses her disbelief that you did not burn the shrimp, as it has never happened before. she then demands you bring her some burnt shrimp first instead. catch another shrimp, cut somestrong seaweednearby, then attempt to cut adead treedown. you will snag one of thesoggy branchesfrom the tree, which allows you to push the boulder into the hole. now the dialogue box for the steam vent has an option to burn the shrimp using the extreme heat. burn the boiled shrimp on the vent, boil the other shrimp, and speak to her again with both shrimps in your inventory. once that has been completed, you will be sent down the path to the next tutor. continuing down the path, you will find a building with another possessed tutor, this timemaster chef lev. talking to him explains that cooking bread is no longer necessary, as salads are all the rage. he will then explain that he's having trouble collecting thetasty seaweedfrom his garden patch, because it is occupied by alarge jellyfish. he has the idea to play some music to solve the issue, but he is too scared to do it himself. obtainlevs music boxfrom him to gather seaweed, then go south of the house. play the music box in front of the jellyfish: pick option 2, then 3, then 1. they will play short bits of old songs fromrunescape 2. gather thetasty seaweed, then talk to the master chef again. place the seaweed on thelarge tableand then pick the correct ingredients. for each column, pick either sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, salty, or mellow, depending on the chef's instructions. for example, if the text reads: 'something mellow yet sour with bitter undertones.' then the order of your columns would be:mellow, sour, and bitter. after this is done, proceed on the path to the next house and go down the ladder. continue travelling on the path to the north and go inside the building. look for a 'cellar' entrance and climb down. you will arrive in thetutorial island mines. talk to themining instructor, who wants you to create your own bronze dagger. your character remarks that it's impossible to work afurnaceunderwater, so you will have to find a way to have it work regardless. minesoggy copper oreandsoggy tin ore, put it in the furnace, close the furnace doors, operate the pump, then light the furnace. after doing this, open the door and yourbronzish baris smelted. click on a nearby anvil to be prompted to smith abronze butter knifethen return to the instructor one last time. when you're done talking to him, head east toward vannaka. whilst talking withvannaka, he believes you have the capability to wield atwo-handed swordin one hand, just as he did. enter the gate and click on the sword and shield in the centre of the enclosure to begin combat training. he now guides you through the encounter. during the blindfolded scene, click on all the water bubbles and rat heads in order to progress. after killing all thegiant sea rats, return to vannaka, then climb the ladder to the north and proceed east from there. exit the caves through the ladder. you will arrive next to the island'sbank, where you will find the next tutor. speak to thefinancial advisorinside the bank. he will reveal that the banker is long dead, as he wasn't transmogrified into a crassian when the island sank. furthermore, he was the only person with the bank pin, and so you need to find a way to figure out the code. read thememoand thebanker's diaryon both tables, and thecalendaron the wall behind the bank booths, then proceed to the vault. the code is the birth year of the banker: ""139"". after opening the vault, talk to the financial advisor. he will let you advance to the next stage of the island. note: a bug may sometimes cause the financial advisor not to respond when you tell you have opened the vault.  teleporting out then returning will fix this issue. next, you will arrive at the tutorial island chapel, where you can findbrother brace. talking to him reveals that he has lost hisprayer book, which he needs in order to let you move on. he will then give you hisfriend list, with the directive to talk to all of hisfish friends. some of them can be located near the chapel, while others can be found west of the bank. they will all act nervous, until one slips up and tells you that they saw it behind a certain piece of scenery, such as the anchor or a cannon or the coral east of the church (the location is different for everyone, however they are all near the church or to the west of the bank). once the fish has given you the location, search it to find the book. once found, take it to brother brace, and he will inform you that the book actually contained the key for the locked door to the next location, hence why he needed it before you could move on. he sends you on your way to speak with the last tutor. finally, talk towizard terrova. he asks you to cast a wind spell on thechickensto prove your competency in magic. the chickens are strangely not cursed, as they have air bubbles around their heads. simply click on the chickens to cast a spell on them. this spell places the chickens in a larger bubble; once a chicken goes into a bubble, another chicken spawns. players need to only defeat one chicken to continue, but are allowed to defeat as many as they wish. once you speak to terrova, you are interrupted byhector vivian, the magician who enacted the curse in the first place. he explains that vannaka is the last piece of his curse, but before doing anything, wizard myrtle dives down, overcoming her fear of deep water, and channels a spell against hector vivian to stop his evil scheme. the player must assist myrtle in channelling the spell, but the player must also repel all thecrassiansthat attempt to disrupt her. it is recommended to click on myrtle rather than clicking on the animation that is between myrtle and hector, because the clickspace is bigger and easier to obtain. crassians appear periodically, often away from myrtle. this buys the player some time to advance the spell, but the player must be quick and repel the crassians. once the crassians are in their bubbles, quickly click on myrtle before another one spawns. repeat until myrtle's (and the player's) meters are completely filled up. once the meters are filled, hector is ""defeated"". in order for the battle to be officially over, the player must finish hector off by trapping him in a bubble. return to the mainland and talk to wizard myrtle. all the

head to thekeldagrim south-west mine(if you are entering through the cave entrance, cross the river by speaking to the ferryman) and speak todondakanthe dwarf; when asked why he is shooting cannonballs at a wall, dondakan explains that the wall is in fact a ""special"" rock by the fact that it is impenetrable. after having no success with a pickaxe and being abandoned by his colleagues, he requests your help in analysing and harnessing this enigma. accept, and he'll suggest entering the dwarf city and finding someone who knows their way around rocks or, if that fails, speaking to the librarian. if you haven't yet completedthe giant dwarfquest, you will need to talk to the dwarven boatman to visit keldagrim for the first time; the boatman is at the entrance upon first crossing the water. in west keldagrim, go inside theconsortium, the largest building there. directly east of the entrance, there'll be adwarven engineer. speak to him and he'll tell you aboutrolad, a renowned scholar who used to work with dondakan on the rock. he eventually left, saying he wanted to travel the world and learn by experiences and was last heard being with theblack guardatice mountain. teleport to the falador lodestone and run north-east or to the edgeville one and head south-west.roladis in the north-eastern building near the entrance to the dwarven mine. mention dondakan and his impervious rock, and he'll suddenly remember procuring a book which had details about the same rock and how it got placed in the keldagrim mines. he had torn out the relevant pages to study them but has unfortunately misplaced the bunch, probably in the nearby underground mines. offer to help in retrieving the pages and climb down the ladder to enter thedwarven mine. note that the pages may require multiple attempts to be obtained. once you gather all 3 pages, they will automatically combine intopages. return toroladwith the pages, and he will give you a book ondwarven lore. read the book to learn about the history of the solid rock and how a certain arzinian being frombordanzanwas trapped inside a mine containing ""yellow stones"" by a few elder dwarves' efforts. the mine collapsed into itself and formed into a single, extremely hard stone form, holding the entity inside it. head back todondakanand inform him about the trapped spirit and the gold. he tells you that the other metals like adamantite, runite, and granite have failed to make a dent on the rock, to which you suggest using a ""yellow material"". show him agold oreorgold baron him and he'll ask you to create agold cannon ballout of it. ensure that you have anammo mouldeither on you or in your toolbelt, otherwise the option to craft the golden cannonball will not appear. you can either walk to the furnace in theconsortiumand craft your golden cannonball there, or, if you've completed theeasy varrock achievements, another option is to teleport toedgevilleand smelt the cannonball at the furnace located just east of the lodestone and then use thegrand exchangetrapdoor shortcut to get to keldagrim. to craft a golden cannonball, either use a gold bar on a furnace, or smith directly from the furnace (both will bring up the dialogue asking you if you want to make a golden cannonball). back in the keldagrim caves, show the golden cannon ball to dondakan. he eventually agrees to try shooting it at the rock. a cutscene ensues in which dondakan fires the golden cannonball, and it passes right through the wall and disappears. astonished and excited, he plainly suggests throwing you at the wall, but he needs the schematics to modify the cannon to be able to fire a human. considering the safe passage of the golden cannonball, he also tells you to make yourself agold helmet, to phase through the wall. to correctly alter the cannon for safely shooting a human, you need to find all 4 sets of schematics: once you have all the schematics, click ""assemble"" on any of the pieces to bring up an interface which shows the schematics, albeit scrambled out of order. this part is simple pattern recognition. try to piece together the humanoid figure medially placed atop the schematics. schematic 1 lines up with the body of the figures, schematic 2 lines up with the head, and schematic 3 lines up with the legs. they can be manipulated one at a time via the check boxes. this will make the pattern much easier to follow and understand. once you put them all in their proper places — some trial and error is required — the screen will show:""that's it! it all makes sense now! if you were a dwarf, that is..."". now you need to make the helm! if you got the dwarven engineer's piece of the schematic last, you may use his anvil to make the helmet. the metal bank will not work, but un-noted gold bars can be withdrawn from the metal bank at the furnace north of the anvil. otherwise, the quickest access to an anvil is to teleport tolumbridgeand use 3 gold bars on the nearby anvil or use an(attuned) teleport crystalto trahaearn. if you've completed the giant dwarf quest, a fast way to get back to keldagrim is by using the train cart in the south-east corridor of the cave under white wolf mountain or use aluck of the dwarves. you may also usefairy ringcode dks and enter keldagrim's cave entrance slightly to the west, then cross the river to get back to dondakan. bank in keldagrim and withdraw any combat gear required to fight a level 50-56 enemy, along with yourgold helmet. make sure to keep six to fifteen free backpack spaces for collecting gold ore (gold ore collected outside will disappear, so will not work during the quest). once you are ready, go back todondakanwith the completed schematics, and ask him to shoot you into the rock. during the cutscene be sure to click the words ""click to continue"". clicking anywhere else will restart the dialogue. once inside the rock, you will be surrounded by gold ore and veins; mine as much as you can. the upcoming enemy's combat level will be anywhere between level 50 and level 56, decided by how much ore you mine. with less than 6 ores, it will be level 56 and have the ability to regenerate infinitely; if the quantity of ores is between 6 and 14 it will be level 53, and with 15 gold ores or more, it will be level 50. the gold ores must be in your backpack (ore boxeswill not work).  you must keep on your gold helmet whilst in the cave; otherwise, you'll be kicked out of it, and all of your mined gold will disappear. you only have eight minutes in there to do everything, so be swift. when you have enough gold, head to the centre of the area, where you will find a set of flames. go through the first wall of flames — do not stay for too long, or you will start taking damage. right-click on the next ring of fire, and select talk. anarzinian avatarwill come and attack you. the spirit can attack with any combat style; which form it takes is dependent on your highest combat skill. if your magic level is higher than the other combat levels, the avatar will attack with ranged. see thecombat trianglefor more details. you can use prayer for an easy fight; the spirit shouldn't take too long to kill. if you are close to dying, you can take your gold helmet off to leave the mine, or, if you fail to defeat the demon within the time frame, you will be teleported outside the mine, losing all mined gold. when you have defeated the demon's avatar, you will be teleported out of the mine. speak todondakanto finish the quest. congratulations, quest complete!

the guard will search you, but he won't find anything conclusive and will allow you to pass. head to thedancing donkey inn(marked with aon the minimap) and talk to the chemist's assistants to get the vials back. your inventory must have space for the three vials. having a full inventory will require you to obtain a new set from elena. head to guidor's house in the south-east corner of the gated area. when attempting to enter the bedroom,guidor's wifewill say that she is waiting for a priest to come and bless guidor. if you hadn't bought them beforehand, you can purchase the priest gown and robes at thefancy clothes storejust north of guidor's house. equip your priest gown and she will let you in. talk to guidor, who says that his wife has kept him under house arrest because of the rumour about the 'plague-carrier'. give him the vials and sample and tell him that elena has sent a sample that needs to be processed. after analysing it, he will come to a surprising conclusion. he tells you that the plague is just a lie and the real question is why. as the samples have now been used, you can carry on using the teleports mentioned previously. return to ardougne and talk to elena. when you tell her that guidor found nothing in his results, she suggests that this must be a hoax and that you should speak to the person on top of this –king lathas. the king is located in his bedroom on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]of the ardougne castle, just south of elena's house. when told that the plague is in fact a hoax, the king replies that he did it for the best of his people, and that it protects them from a ""far greater danger"". he then tells the player about the journey ofking tyras– the king of west ardougne and king lathas's brother – towards the west and that he has been corrupted by drinking from the chalice of eternity. hence, the wall has been erected between the cities to protect east ardougne and in turn, all of gielinor. biohazard is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

theconsortiumand thedwarven black guardand externally with the local trolls and thereturn of the gods. ask him what he intends to do and he'll say the main threat isthe red axe. after theirlast attackfailed, they've been quiet, but he doesn't want to wait for them to show their hand. he wants to attack theirbasebefore they can make a move, using the power of black guard and his alliance with the local trolls to destroy them once and for all. he asks for your help setting his plans in motion, as you're the only one he can trust. there are three issues that he wants you to address: veldaban gives you aroyal dwarven sealto mark you as his agent during these tasks. it is unnecessary to return to him after completing each individual task; you can talk to him after finishing all three to save some time. veldaban says that brae will explain how to go about investigating the suspected spies. he also adds that if any are found to be working with the red axe, the penalty is death. any that have committed treason but cannot be linked to the red axe should be exiled as far from keldagrim as possible. enter the records chamber cave to the west of the bank (along the west wall). inside you will find lieutenant brae with four prisoners:brendt,klaas,vigr, andgrundt. brae will explain that she cannot hold them for much longer without charging them with a crime, and asks when veldaban is coming. you tell her he sent you instead, and show her the seal. ask her who the suspects are. talk tovigr, who is a tradesman, selling warhammers in the northeast room on the northwest side of the palace'sground floor[uk]1stfloor[us], on the west side of the river. he was a member of the red axe prior to their banishment, but it is unknown if he is still in contact with them. vigr will refuse to be questioned, and will only do so if there is physical proof of his involvement. go tovigr's workshopin the northeast corner of keldagrim palace's westernground floor[uk]1stfloor[us]. it is currently bedecked inorange flamebanners and occupied bysieglinde, who doesn't object to the place being searched. you find abundle of lettershidden under the furnace. they are correspondence between vigr and a red axe spymaster, ceasing around the time veldaban took the throne. take these back to vigr, and he will admit that hewasa spy, but that the red axe abandoned all of its agents in keldagrim after veldaban was crowned. he claims that if he was contacted again, he would refuse to spy for them, and insists he is no threat to veldaban. brae asks you to pass judgement at this point, and vigr begs for mercy, asking you to send him into exile instead. the choice is up to you. klaas is a member of thekeldagrim monarchist society, but he's been calling for people to overthrow veldaban on the basis of him not being the rightful king. this is treason itself, but it could be instigated by the red axe. klaas insists that the other monarchists agree with him, and that calling for the overthrow of an ""usurper"" is not treason. his reasoning for veldaban's illegitimacy is that veldaban has not dissolved the consortium, and that he keeps advisers around him. he says there's been no real change since veldaban took the throne, and that the people should depose him for the rightful king. he denies red axe involvement, stating that they would be worse than veldaban, and that meike knows he wouldn't work with them. go to theking's axe inn, south of the bank, and speak to meike. make sure you go through all the dialogue including asking her if he got the idea from the red axe, which should come up after you've asked her about the idea. she knows that klaas was asking for a revolution, but she says that being involved with the red axe doesn't fit the klaas she knows. go back to the records chamber and talk to klaas again, telling him that meike has vouched for him. when brae tells you it's time to pass judgement, he will reiterate that he doesn't recognise the authority of the king. you can choose to let him go, execute him or exile him. brendt and grundt are traders who were arrested onjatizsoafter they mentioned the red axe while picking up an ore shipment from king sorvott. the length of time that they stayed on the island, after their business was done, raised suspicion of them being spies. they both claim they were there to pick up an ore shipment they'd bought. ask brendt why king sorvott said he'd mentioned the red axe, and brendt will explain that the king was mistaken by the nickname of their ship's captain, named redaxe for his red, axe-shaped beard. cross over to grundt and ask what the captain's nickname was, and he'll say that the captain was named sigridsdottir, a female name, and he doesn't know if she had one. when you ask him about the king's claim, he'll stammer his way through an explanation about carrying a literal red axe. go back to brendt, and ask him what weapon grundt carried on jatizso. he isn't sure, and doesn't think that grundt even took his weapon out of his cabin the whole trip. speak to grundt about the captain again to reset the dialogue options, then confront brendt with grundt's belief that the captain was called sigridsdottir. he'll insist that grundt is mistaken and that the captain was called redaxe. brae will call on you to pass judgement, first on brendt, then on grundt. brendtisa spy, and is unrepentant about it. grundt is also a spy, but he begs for his life if you choose to execute him, claiming he will never work for the red axe again. once you have decided the fates of all four suspects, your task here is finished. veldaban is assuming that any chaos dwarves found in the world were created by the same process that the red axe used, and therefore must be linked to the rogue corporation. he wants to make sure that the red axe is not operating so dangerously close to both human and dwarven lands. your mission is to go to taverley dungeon and keep an eye out for anything suspicious while you kill the chaos dwarves there. entertaverley dungeonand proceed to the southern end, where chaos dwarves reside. if you can use the pipe shortcut (70 agility, boostable), it will save a lot of time to get to the dwarves. kill chaos dwarves untilikadia the exileappears, who tells you that she has the information you seek. she will then teleport away to thechaos druidarea in the north-eastern corner of the dungeon, so go there and talk to her again. she will offer to give you the information if you beat her in a duel. she is a level 126 mage with 10000 life points and can use abilities in combat. her weakness is arrows, but she is fairly easy to defeat with any combat style. once you have defeated her, she will give you the information you need and happily ask you to kill her, but you have the option not to do so. veldaban knows that you once used a potion to kill the ogre shamans under gu'tanoth. he wants you to askthe wizardfor that help again, to defend against the memory-wiping shaman employed by the red axe. the wizard is located on the top floor of thewatchtower. if you haven't done thewatchtowerquest, simply climb up the trellis on the north face of the tower for access to it. mention to the wizard that you need to fight another ogre shaman, except this one is capable of erasing memories. shocked, he will exclaim a ""regular""magic ogre potionwon't do the trick and the memory-wiping must be countered somehow. the wizard will give you amemory wandto calibrate first before using it against grunsh. you may not have a follower out during this step. use the wand on all the strange items (beers and kebabs). they will release four fragments, which will speed around the area. catch each fragment and then investigate each red memory void. a message will appear, telling you which fragment to use on the item. a total of four fragments are needed for each category. if you get it wrong, you must collect the fragments again. after completing the puzzle, a cutscene will occur where the player sees the red axe gathering an army. once again,grunshwill find you eavesdropping and, instead of erasing your memory, will calibrate the wand. when the cutscene ends, record of the questforgettable tale of a drunken dwarfwill be corrected. return to veldaban with the wand to show him the red axe's plans. the wand cannot be banked. once you have finished all of the king's tasks, return to veldaban and after updating him tell him you will meet him in thebarendirtunnels. to reach the tunnels, talk to thedwarven boatmansituated on the eastern side of the river, just north of the palace, to travel to the area located south of dondakan's rock and proceed to run east to the barendir tunnels. enter the tunnels and run north east past the sparkly crystals and enter the cave at the end. talk to king veldaban, at the far north of the cave, and he will instruct you to talk tonulodionnext to him. nulodion will give youexplosive gearsto sabotage the cannons during the assault. fire the cannon that is pointed at the wall, and there will be a cut-scene showing the battle against the chaos dwarves. if you need to grab any food or potions, theblack guard quartermasterwill allow you to access your bank. you cannot bring a familiar to the lava flow mine, as the game will prevent you from doing so. if you die, simply re-enter the way you came in. your gravestone will be a short distance away in the tunnels. the black guard and trolls enter the chaos dwarf lava flow mine. grimsson lowers the bridge. the cannons force the trolls and guard to flee. turn on theprotect from rangedprayer as soon as you enter, as the cannon fire dealsheavydamage (4000 or so). to reach the first two cannons on the middle section, run to the western part of the arena and stand behind the pillar. the cannons will fire at the pillar, and it will take two hits to be knocked down. when it's knocked down, click on it to walk across and you'll be able to disable the first two cannons. when the cannons explode it does about 500 damage if you're standing next to it, which is insignificant compared to the damage you'll be taking with fully-operational cannons. there will also be enemies attacking you but they deal virtually no damage. consider killing some enemies for adrenaline so that you can utilise defensive abilities (e.g.devotion,reflect,resonance) if you cannot sustain the damage. after you disable the second cannon in the middle platform, there will be another pillar on the east side of the middle section. hide behind it until it also gets knocked over, then cross over to the far side and disable the last three cannons. if you die, your gravestone will appear somewhere in the barendir tunnel. any cannons you have destroyed will be repaired. when returning, make sure you have space to receive the explosive gear used to destroy the cannons. once the cannons are destroyed, head west and up a platform to confront grimsson. he will flee in a minecart, and veldaban will give chase. pull the lever on top of the platform to raise the bridges, then jump in the remaining minecart to continue. after getting on the minecart you will confront hreidmar and grimsson. if you find yourself outside, re-enter to see the cut-scene. make sure you have your wand or the ogre will cast a spell on you and you'll be teleported out to the cave entrance. the ogre will attempt to plant false memories into veldaban, but the memory wand will be used to stop it. after that, the player, veldaban, grimsson, hreidmar, and the ogre will be dragged into the false memories. veldaban will ""remember"" fighting the trolls with a zamorakian army of dwarves in thebattle of barendir. grimsson will remember being in the battle, slaughtering the trolls. hreidmar will remember being told by zamorak himself to take the throne for himself, since he is the rightful heir. the wand must be used on the royal red axe standard, the zamorakian chaplain, and the dwarf standing next to him, and the memories must be corrected like earlier in the quest. there are three of each type. after that, you will arrive in grimsson's memory. there are six troll fragments and six dwarf fragments. use the wand on the two trolls directly next to grimsson. dwarf bone is the name of the large troll to the right of the small troll, not an actual dwarf bone. next, you will arrive in hreidmar's memory, where he is talking tozamorak, who is revealed to only be a statue. there are six fragments. use the wand on zamorak. finally, the ogre's memory must be fixed. the wand must be used on each of the three dwarves in the room to release all the memory fragments. grunsh will refuse to see his memories, so you must forcefully apply it on him. he will cast a spell that turns a ""pure"" memory into a dangerous form. if you grab any dangerous memories, the existing memories captured will all be released. dangerous memories turn back into standard memories after a few moments. there are three of each type of memory. do not gather dangerous memories. this is vital as it will reset your progress with any previously gathered memories. once all memories are caught in their ""pure"" form, they must be used on the voids like earlier in the quest. after this, everyone will wake up. you will learn that grunsh's memories are also wiped clean, and believes that hreidmar saved him from a snowy place. after that veldaban says you will need to kill grunsh, and once again you can choose to let him live or to kill him. after this point, the wand is no longer necessary in the quest. players are unable to bank this item, so the only option for getting rid of it is to destroy it. or, you can keep it and use it on veldaban after the quest is over to restore memories ofhilda. once you enter through the doorway directly behind veldaban, you will come to an empty version of the keldagrim palace. going up the stairs on either side brings you to an identical trade floor populated only by chaos dwarves dressed up asred axe directorsand traders, all speaking gibberish regarding zamorak and chaos. before you speak to any of the directors, you must attempt to open the door on the east side where a chaos dwarf is, who will refuse to let you in as you are not a member of the red axe. then, right click to speak to any red axe director and tell him that your friend wishes to join the red axe. the director wishes to be more powerful than the others so veldeban proposes that you kill the remaining 7 directors scattered around the floor. once they are all dead, speak to the director again and he will pronounce veldaban a full-fledged member of the red axe (you can kill any 7 directors, including the one you spoke to, and the surviving director will make you a member of the red axe. it is also possible to kill the surviving director after). continue through the door at the east of the floor. once the final battle has started, the cave at the end of the barendir tunnel will lead directly to the top floor of the red axe palace. if you die during these battles, your grave will appear in the barendir tunnel, as in the previous battle. if you wish to abandon the battle at any point and restock, simply go down the palace stairs and log out to the lobby. when you log back in you will be at the black guard quartermaster where you can access your bank. the battle can be divided into three phases: the fight against grimsson in his normal dwarf form, the fight against grimsson in his chaos dwarf form, and the fight against hreidmar in his chaos dwarf form (the chaos dwarf bosses can be done in either order). once each phase is complete, it will remain complete if you leave and re-enter the battle. the fight will begin with a confrontation of the two. after a short cutscene plays, grimsson will attack veldaban. theprovokeability can be used to direct grimsson's attacks away from veldaban, except when grimsson is provoke immune. attack grimsson but keep an eye on his adrenaline bar because when it's full, grimsson will becomeprovoke immuneand do a charge attack that does very high damage very quickly. the player can counteract this with an ultimate ability or a stun. when grimsson's adrenaline is at 50%, he will grab veldaban for several seconds. during this time, any damage dealt to grimsson will be redirected to veldaban, so it is very important that you stop attacking during this period. after several seconds he will throw veldaban at you, dealing a typeless 1000+ to you and 7500 to veldaban. the damage to you can be circumvented by hiding behind a pillar, but veldaban will still take damage. if veldaban dies, the battle will restart. the best method to separate grimsson from veldaban is to open the door to the throne room, get back a few steps, let grimsson throw veldaban at you. veldaban will be thrown out of the room, quickly shut the door, which will make you stand between veldaban and the door. when you open the door, you will be between veldaban and grimsson; grimsson will still attack veldaban with range, but it's not that deadly, you can finish grimsson without taking any damage. standing on the same square as veldaban and using kick will also separate grimsson and veldaban. once grimsson is dead, another cutscene will play. hreidmar will grab adragon battlestaff, before channeling a spell to turn him, veldaban and the deceased grimsson into chaos dwarves. veldaban will succumb to the spell, but does not fully turn into a chaos dwarf, so you only need to deal with hreidmar and grimsson. hreidmar casts a spell using hisdragon battlestaff. king veldaban is corrupted by the spell. grimsson is resurrected and turned into a chaos dwarf. you must now face both hreidmar and grimsson, and veldaban will be incapacitated and unable to assist you. each chaos dwarf boss is a challenging battle in its own right, so the usual strategy is to split them up and fight them one at a time. if the instance is not completed and the player leaves before both are killed the instance resets itself, both chaos dwarf bosses have to be defeated in one go.  the easiest way to separate them is to use the stairway: if you go down the stairs and back up, then hreidmar becomes unaggressive, so you can deal with grimsson first. the bottom of the stairway is also a safe spot where you can heal. if you die during the fight, your grave will appear in thebarendircaves. teleport to rellekka lodestone ordks, enter keldagrim, then walk east and enter the barendir caves. your grave will be here. entering the cave north in the barendir tunnel retriggers the fight. remember if you take degradable armour with you, then take them as the threeitems you keep on death, otherwise they will degrade by 10-20%. grimsson fights with ranged and melee. he has two special abilities: hreidmar fights withmagic. he has four special abilities: there are two ways to separate hreidmar from the minions. you can go down the stairs so that hreidmar becomes non-aggressive, or you can stand in the doorway and close it when the minions are summoned. kill the minions (avoiding the supercharged minion blast which can damage you through the wall and down the stairs), and return to killing hreidmar (make sure the door closes before you go to fight minions or he will buff them). when fighting hreidmar, pay attention to his adrenaline bar. when it is full, he will attempt to heal himself for 12000 life points. this can only be counteracted by dealing a large amount of damage to him in a certain period of time. ultimate abilities, such asomnipower, and even some high-damage thresholds, are the best way to stop him from healing. he will also attempt to empower the summoned hand cannoneers in a similar manner, and likewise can be stopped the same way, by dealing a large amount of damage (this won't be a problem if you have used the stairway method to make hreidmar non-aggressive while fighting the minions). if necessary, it's possible to recover some health from the minions by using the adrenaline gained to activateregenerate,rejuvenate, orguthix's blessing. however this must be balanced against the loss of adrenaline for fighting hreidmar. after defeating hreidmar and grimsson, talk to veldaban, who is kneeling in the throne room. veldaban says that he doesn't like what he is turning into, and he requests for the player to kill him in order for the effect to stop. you have a choice of either letting veldaban survive or killing him. a cutscene will ensue where the trolls and dwarves bring down the statue of hreidmar. if you let him survive, then the player and veldaban will meet the consortium and discuss who should be the king of keldagrim. again, the player has another choice of either letting veldaban rule keldagrim, or tell him to step down, letting the consortium rule. if veldaban is killed, then you have the option of allowing the consortium to rule, or finding the true heir to the throne:king drunken dwarf iii. after the quest, if you let veldaban survive, the next time you see him on the throne he will appear to be completely unaffected by the chaos dwarf transformation, indicating he's been able to successfully fight it off. after choosing your options, you will finish the quest automatically. if your inventory is full after the cutscene, you can speak to a director to claim your rewards. you must have at least 3 free inventory spaces to claim them. congratulations, quest complete!  birthright of the dwarves is not currently required for any quests or miniquests."

xenia will recommend melee. he is fairly accurate for his level, easily hitting constant 10s on players with 1defenceand no armour. for lower levelled players, it is recommend that they get close to him while taking advantage of the walls on either side of the chamber to reduce damage. using abilities such asslicewill allow you to do more damage. for rangers,piercing shotcan be used and for mages,wrackcan be used. after defeating him, you may ask him about the other cultists to which he says that caitlin was a student of the wizards' tower and that's how they chose ilona for the ritual. reese was an acolyte in the lumbridge church who, along with caitlin, came up with the whole idea. you may also question him about the trio's intentions, and he will explain that he really didn't know what he was getting himself into. at this point, you may choose whether to kill him or spare him his life, either of which will cause him to drop hischargebow, which you may then take. your choice will slightly affect some of the later dialogue in the quest, but the final outcome and rewards will be the same in either case. additionally, your choice will influence ilona (the aspiring-mage girl you are trying to rescue) after the quest, as she will choose to practice nonlethal magic if you spare either kayle or caitlin (the next enemy), but she will practice elemental combat magic if you choose to kill them. her chosen magic does not affect future gameplay. if you do not already have arangedweapon, pick up the chargebow that kayle dropped and proceed to the next chamber.caitlin, the second cultist, will be waiting across the room from you. you will be forced to use long-ranged attacks against her as you will not be able to get within melee distance of her. she will attack you usingmagicattacks, and thus it is recommended to use ranged to defeat her, ranged being superior to magic in thecombat triangle. she seems to be easier than kayle, as even though her spells are more accurate, she does not hit as hard. after defeating her, operate a winch found in the room to cross to the other side of the room. you cannot do this while she is attacking you. when you question caitlin about the group's intentions, she says that the dungeon is actually the tomb ofdragith nurn, who was a powerful necromancer. it was he who had built the catacombs for himself and the cultists had planned to use the power stored in his body to unlock the secrets of his work and gain power over life and death. again, players will have the choice to kill her or to spare her; whichever choice you make, caitlin will drop herstaffon the floor. as with kayle, your choice will affect some dialogue in the quest, and it will slightly affect ilona's character development after the quest, depending also upon whether you killed or spared kayle. the quest's final outcome and rewards are unaffected. if you talk to xenia about dragith nurn, she will explain that he had a magical workshop beneath lumbridge and that he used to rob graves for his necromancy experiments. she convinced him to stop all of them, so he trapped all the undead in the lower level of his workshop and sealed it off. the upper level of his workshop is where the tomb lays. contrary to what the cultists believed, dragith nurn used this tomb to hide the entrance to the lower level, where he buried himself along with the undead. after speaking to xenia, descend the stairs at the end of caitlin's room to confront the last member of the trio.reese, the final cultist, will be waiting for you. after speaking to him for a short while, it will become clear that you cannot dissuade him from his plans, and he will attack you. you may defeat him by using any means of combat, but xenia recommends usingmagic, namelyair strike. after defeating reese, you may further question him about his plans. you will once again have to choose whether or not to spare his life. however, even if you choose to spare reese, he will commit suicide by drinking from a vial of poison, realising that his plans had failed. the coffin in the room to the south will crumble and reveal a set of stairs out of the catacombs. untie ilona, and she will relate her story to you back at the surface. after defeating reese, you will appear outside the lumbridge catacombs with xenia and ilona, and xenia will reward you. congratulations, quest complete! the blood pact is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

quest is a sequel toglorious memoriesandhorror from the deep. through much of the quest, you frequently need to restock and pass throughrellekka. consider moving yourplayer-owned houseto rellekka, as this would be a convenient way to return to the action. you can also use anenchanted lyrefor quick access to rellekka. another option is to cast the home teleport tolunar isleand take the boat back to rellekka. after the questlove story, players can also chisel ateleport to housetablet to create a teleport tablet to the rellekka player-owned house portal without moving the player's house to rellekka. thefremennik province lodestonenear rellekka is also a convenient option. travel to the lunar isle to speak withbaba yagain herchicken-leg house. talk to her about the man in the bed. she tells you he washed up on the shore and asks if you can help her. she says you two can travel to the sick man'sdream worldand find the root of his problem. she reminds you that anything can happen in a dream world, so she suggests you prepare for war. she says to meet her back in her house when you are ready. during this trip with baba yaga, you are attacked by level 81dagannothsthat use melee and ranged (weak to air spells), and a level 84wallasalkithat uses magic. you do not need to kill them (since they will just respawn), but you do need to survive their attacks for a few minutes while baba yaga works to get you two off the platform and back to her house. if you die, yourgravestonewill appear nearbaba yaga'shouse. use the lunar home teleport, or the moonclan lodestone, to arrive right next to the moonclan bank within seconds. bring good defensive armour and a weapon. bring a dozen or sosharksor higher-healing food andprayer potions. turn on theprotect from meleeprayer when they arrive. also, you may want to bring mage or range with you to try to attack the level 88 and level 98 because they will be on a different platform. a protection aura, such asaegis, orvampyrismis recommended to reduce the amount of food needed. you do notneedto attack the dagannoth, as they respawn a few seconds later, but it is a good idea to do so if you have thesaradomin godsword/enhanced excalibur(for the passive effect) or a shield (for the o.a. theresonanceability), vampyrism orsoul split. once you are ready, talk to baba yaga in her house again. in acutscene, you and baba yaga go to theceremonial brazierand then enter the man's dreams. in the dream, you find yourself on the first floor of thelighthouseand figure out that the man issilas, the previouslighthousekeeper. choose the listen silas option on silas to hear what he is muttering as he writes in his journal. baba yaga then suggests you search the room. search the bookcase on the north side of the platform to find aprophecy tablet. if you have no empty inventory slots,baba yagawill take the tablet for safekeeping. talk tobaba yagaagain, and she wonders where the stairs lead. climb the stairs. you see rows and rows of dagannoth below you, walking out of a tunnel. talk to baba yaga, who suggests you listen for anything. choose to eavesdrop-on either silas or the dagannoth mother. you learn that thedagannoth motheris gathering an army to attack ""the barbarian port"" ofrellekka. she says the ""jah-nay islands"" (jatizsoandneitiznot) will not attack her army once they see what the dagannoth have done to rellekka, and that misk island (miscellania) will quickly surrender, once its citizens realise the dagannoth have captured theirking. the mother goes on to say that once her children have developed the new immunities she has mastered, the world will be their toy. after listening in, baba yaga says you two need to find a lectern to escape and suggests going through the tunnel. enter the tunnel to the west on your platform. you and baba yaga find yourselves on another platform, with silas slumped over on the ground and a lectern to the south holding a book calledour lives. talk to silas — who asks who you are — and then try to read the book onlectern, which isn't working. baba yaga says she will have to study the lectern, but silas hysterically says the mother has sent the dagannoth after you. turn on theprotect from meleeprayer, eat when you have to, and stay alive while baba yaga figures out what is wrong with the lectern. occasionally baba yaga will heal you, but only a certain amount of times, as she has limited sharks to heal herself — she will announce how many she has. she will also sometimes cast vengeance on your character. if you brought range or mage weapons, you can take out the wallasalki and the ranging dagannoth on the platform across from you, to prevent taking damage whilst using protect from melee. both of them will respawn a short while after, and will try to retreat after being attacked, but less damage will be taken than if they are left alone. the dagannoth appearing from the nearby cave will typically line up, and since they use melee, you will only have to deal with a couple. a good strategy is to stand in the corner between the lectern and silas. this way you will create a bottle-neck, so only one melee dagannoth can attack you. do not use yourdwarf multicannonin this area or you will lose it. after the fight, baba yaga will congratulate you, mentioning how close the battle was, and you will both leave the platform and find yourself back in thechicken-leg house. you will be safe back in her house. you can restock at this point, if you are not ready to fight another large group of dagannoth. when you are ready, talk to baba yaga. theoneiromancerappears in her house and talks to baba yaga, using an unknown communication method, probably telepathy. ask what is happening. the leader of themoon clantells you rellekka is under attack by hordes of ""daggermouths."" she asks you to go help, and offers to get you to rellekka quickly. (her trick relies on outdated game behaviour: previously if you tried to talk to a moon clan member without a seal of passage in your inventory, you'd be expelled and find yourself in rellekka. so baba yaga's trick is to take away your seal of passage so that she no longer recognises you and expels you to rellekka. oddly, this works even if you don't have a seal of passage.) note that if you travel to rellekka any other way, you will not see the attacking dagannoth, just the city as normal. in rellekka, join the fremennik in defending their city against level 77 dagannoth that use melee and ranged attacks.protect from meleeis recommended, and keep an eye on damage from the ranging dagannoth. for faster kills, help the fremennik instead of fighting alone. a cannon greatly speeds up the process. guthans is also a useful method of fighting them. using the vampyrism aura will limit the amount of food you need. after 50 dagannoth kills,brundt the chieftaincalls for you to join him on his ship on the indicated dock, marked with a yellow flashing arrow. on the longship, speak withqueen sigrid. she tells you thatking vargasis missing and that the two of them are engaged to be married. she then gives you the mightybalmung. she mentions to not let vargas near the axe, as he can be so clumsy at times. you can also speak to your own beloved (princess astridorprince brand) on the boat if you want. in case you have a full inventory while talking to queen sigrid, you can get balmung by talking to brundt the chieftain in his longhouse in rellekka. after receiving the balmung, talk to brundt and ask him for another seal of passage. he tells you to keep an eye out forbarduron waterbirth island as he might have seen something. if you are ready, go towaterbirth island. if you are not, go with brundt back to rellekka to prepare or have him take you to the bank onetceteria. if you choose etceteria, he drops you off just west of the bank. it may be convenient for the rest of the quest to set your lyre to travel to waterbirth island rather than rellekka, by right clicking the enchanted lyre and selecting waterbirth island under 'change teleport location'. warning:your trip through thewaterbirth dungeonwill take you through several rooms. you'll be attacked from all three sides of thecombat triangle, so wear good all-around defensive armour. bring a fewprayer potions; lots of high-healing food for yourself andking vargas; and maybe even a usefulfamiliar, such as abeast of burdento carry more supplies, or a healer (abunyiporunicorn stallionfor example). leave one space open for a ropebardurwill give you. if death occurs in this dungeon, your gravestone will appear inside the dungeon where you died. once onwaterbirth island, go just north-east of the entrance to thewaterbirth island dungeonto findbardur. ask him if he's seen anything strange. he tells you he is hearing voices, like an old man's. talk to him again. he tells you he saw a hole on top of the island ""round to the south"" from where you are standing, near asnape grassspawn andhobgoblins. he gives you aropeto go down the hole. make your way round to the south-western tip of the island, and choose the tie-rope option on the hole and then climb down the hole into the entrance of thedagannoth guardian dungeon. once down in the cave, you see an injuredking vargasnorth-east of the rope. talk to him, and he tells you he is being held captive. you may want to turn off run, as vargas is too injured to keep up with you otherwise. bardur yells down that ""daggermouths"" are swarming around the cave entrance above and you'll have to find another way out. vargas tells you of another way, through an underwater passage that puts you in the middle of thewaterbirth dungeon. he also asks for food but then says you should hold on to it for now. later, in one of the rooms, you will need to feed him to keep him alive when he is under attack. tell him you will stay close to him when the option arises. if you die in this part, your gravestone will appear outside the entrance to the dagannoth cave. upon death your balmung will not appear under your gravestone, however it can be freely re-obtained from chief brundt back in rellekka. proceed north and then east to the ladder at the end of the corridor. take your time and turn off run, as vargas, limping, has difficulty keeping up with you. don't get too far ahead of him, or the dagannoth will get him and return him to the first chamber. vargas walks slower than walking pace, so make sure to stop and let him catch up with you. climb down the ladder, and you find yourself in room 15 on sublevel 5 ofwaterbirth dungeon. see the map to the right for the path to take from this room out of the dungeon. this first room contains awallasalkiwith magic attacks,rock lobsterswith fast melee attacks, anddagannothwith ranged and melee attacks. the rock lobsters can deal a lot of damage if you don't turn onprotect from melee. they are level 100 and have a highdefence, they can hit twice as fast as a whip. give them a wide berth as you pass them - some may not notice you and will not attack. head to the far-east side of the chamber, past thesmall obelisk, and climb up the next ladder. in this second chamber on the map to the right, you and the king are among a group of dagannoth attacking with melee and ranged. kill the dagannoth that are attacking king vargas, and use food on him to keep him alive. you need to kill or distract the dagannoth attacking vargas before you can climb up the ladder. one method is to be on theancient spellbookand castice burstorice barrageon the dagannoth attacking vargas, freezing them and giving vargas time to escape. alternatively, when in a room of monsters using only a single attack style (wallasalkis- magic,dagannoths- ranged,rock lobsters- melee), attack each of the monsters before they notice king vargas, using the appropriate protection prayer. this can be quite a drain on one's prayer points, so bringing a prayer potion along can be useful. climb up the ladder at the west side of the chamber. after exiting the second room, the only monsters left to pass are rock lobsters, which do not target king vargas. make your way through the last two rooms. after reaching the final room,king vargasclimbs the ladder first, and a trap set by the dagannoth causes rocks to fall, killing you. you awake to find yourself in thefremennik spiritual realm, where fallenfremennikwarriors go when they die. this will be your future respawn until the quest is over. if you leave the spiritual realm or log out, you may return by getting aletterfrombrundt the chieftainand continue from then on. talk witheir— who explains where you are — and then withnial swiftflingandasleif hamalsdotter, who have walked up to the two of you. after speaking with all of them, talk again witheirso she can take you back to your friends. you wake up on brundt's longboat. talk with brundt, who explains what happened. speak next withking vargas. he gives you aprophecy tablethe found in the dagannoth cave. vargas withqueen sigridthen tell you they wish to be married on the boat and ask you to conduct the wedding ceremony. marry the royal couple, choosing whichever options you feel are appropriate. following the ceremony, your own betrothed (eitherprince brandorprincess astrid) suggests that the two of you also get married. you can agree or choose not to marry by selecting the ""let's discuss it later"" option. (any choice is fine, as events later in the quest will show.) even if you have changed your gender since the original quest, you will have the option to get married. finally, talk to brundt, who offers to take you to rellekka or to the bank on etceteria. ahead you will face 2 fights - first against thedagannoth sentinelsand then continuing straight on for a battle with thedagannoth mother. youneedto bringbalmung, a ranged weapon, and a magic weapon with runes for all 4 elemental spells, as the dagannoth mother will not change her weakness if you are not able to hit her. it is possible to kill the sentinels and then teleport out to prepare for the second battle. get ready for a battle: back in rellekka, talk with brundt in the long hall about the war against the daggermouths. tell him you are ready to go. you see a dramatic cutscene of the fremennik fleet sailing for waterbirth island. on board a ship, talk with baba yaga and brundt about the meaning of theprophecy tablets. you three work out that the daughter of the olddagannoth motherhas grown up and become thenew motherto the dagannoth. to prevent a new mother from emerging again, instead of killing the mother, you must weaken her severely and then seal her in her chamber. on waterbirth island, head to the dungeon entrance on the south-western tip of the island, where you originally found king vargas, and climb down. in the chamber, you findkoschei the deathless,baba yaga, and theprinceandprincessof miscellania. talk to them, and then try to enter the tunnel to the south of where you are standing. koschei says he will watch the entrance to the tunnel. in the second chamber, attempt to enter the tunnel to the south. you hear a roar, and koschei enters the chamber and says thedagannoth kingshave entered the hatchery. he needs help, so the rest of your companions go back with koschei while you go on to finish the quest by yourself. enter the third cave, where you find the twodagannoth sentinels(level 98). the sentinels are powerful guardians of the dagannoth mother. they use all three combat styles against the player: a melee attack, the signature dagannoth ranged attack, and a water-based spell similar to thewallasalki. they also have a ""rallying cry"" that they'll use if one sentinel's life points fall too far below the other, which will cause the weaker one to heal. sinceeocthere are currently several bugs during this fight. they are detailed below with possible work-arounds. the preferred strategy to beat them is to usebalmung, as they have a weakness to both it and slash damage. bring whatever armour you would like, but level 60 or above is recommended. hybrid armour is strongly suggested, especially if you intend to follow on to the dagannoth mother immediately after this fight. using area-of-effect abilities can be extremely helpful for lowering both of their health at the same time. due to a glitch caused by eoc, some players may find that they are unable to target, and likewise attack the second sentinel. the easiest way to circumvent this is to stand on top of one sentinel, and then use range or magic to kill the other. the first will keep attempting to attack you, but cannot, and therefore will not attempt to heal his companion. another method is to simply use balmung to power through its health faster than it can regenerate. another bug exists, however, that may cause the rallying cry to fully heal the dagannoth. if this happens to you then the simplest method is to use an ultimate ability such as berserk, build up to your threshold, and then drop it one hit. if you bring abeast of burden,titan, or other attackingfamiliar, you can set it to attack one of sentinels while you alternate between the two: the sentinels will not heal damage inflicted by a familiar's attacks. they do not respawn after you've defeated them. you can take this opportunity to bank and return, or press on to the dagannoth mother if you feel well prepared for it. from the now-empty dagannoth sentinel chamber, enter the tunnel to the south to get to the next cave. you'll find manydagannoth guardianshere. make your way through the cave, avoiding the guardians: head east, climb over an obstruction, loop around to the eastern side of the middle section of the cave, enter a tunnel entrance (a small crevice beyond the rubble), and then head south. you find the entrance to the dagannoth mother's chamber at the end of this tunnel. much like themotherfromhorror from the deepand thegelatinnoth motherfromthe final subquestofrecipe for disaster, this newmothersignals her weakness by the colour on her back. unlike those preceding mothers, however, her colour changes do not follow a predictable pattern. instead, she randomly moves between colours and sticks with colours you either didn't bring a weapon for or you yourself have a lower combat level in. to cover her shifting vulnerabilities, bring the requiredbalmung, runes for casting each of the four elemental spells, amagic weapon, and aranged weapon. she is a strong foe, using a powerful melee attack up close—which can strike for 1000 or morelife points—as well as range and mage attacks. she does not move toward you to attack with melee, so you can attack with mage and range from a distance and then guard against her mage and range attacks.protection prayersordeflect cursescan prevent a lot of damage. players should bring the highest level hybrid armour they can. for your inventory, consider aprayer potionor two, asuper defence potion, a ranged weapon, a magic weapon, and enough air, water, earth, and fire runes to cast each of the four elemental spells at least 50 to 100 times, and the rest high-healingfood. abeast of burdenfilled with extra supplies would be useful. after you enter her chamber, the dagannoth mother will briefly speak with you. be prepared to turn on yourprotect from meleeprayer, because she attacks you after the short dialogue and can hit over 1000 with melee. the mother's stripe will be grey at first and will not change until you hit her with thebalmung, which activates her colour changes. you will not be able to leave the fight except by teleporting out. if you die while fighting her, you will end up in thefremennik spiritual realmagain.eirgives you the option of returning towaterbirth islandor your regularrespawnspot. you don't lose regular items when you die, so you can return to a bank and re-stock before trying to fight again. you still lose items you normally lose on dying, such asfremennik sea boots 3. since the eoc update, ancient magicks now work for hitting her elemental weaknesses. the following table lists the mother's vulnerabilities: note: orange may appear as grey, depending on your graphic settings. if you cannot clearly see her colour changes, go tographicssettings and try setting lighting detail to low. your chat box also tells you what colour she has changed to. you will do little or no damage if you are not attacking the correct weakness. see thedagannoth motherpage for more on how to fight her. currently, it is also possible to defeat her with food andnecromancy. though your attacks will not hit,putrid zombie's poison will so simply bring enough food to survive until it brings her down, noting you need to continue to attack to maintainadrenaline. enter the dagannoth mother's chambers. you are in a small antechamber with abronze pickaxe, aplank, and atinderboxto the west. enter the tunnel to the south to find the dagannoth mother. after a brief conversation, get ready to turn on yourprotect from meleeprayer because she is about to attack you. after her attack, begin the fight with thebalmung. your balmung attack damages the mother and initiates her colour changes. another option is to poison her, stand in the safe spot and wait for the mother to run out of life points! if you are mainly using range and mage attacks, step back, keep your distance, and switch to yourprotect from missilesprayer. eat as needed, and change your attack style to match her changing colours. some players report that they can't hit the mother with weapons or spells after the first hit. these players should retry it using legacy combat (bug may still persist regardless of change use hybrid armour). when the mother runs out of life points, she collapses, yells ""no! you cannot do this!"" but does not die. after the mother has collapsed, if yourfamiliarattacks her, she may briefly stand up and retaliate against you, possibly causing damage. to be safe, keep on theprotect from meleeprayer until you are out of her chamber, if you are using a familiar. if you are wearing a ring of life and are teleported but manage to kill the mother before this, the mother will be lying on the ground just as if you had killed her. exit her chamber, and return to the small antechamber, which contains the pickaxe, plank, and tinderbox. in the small antechamber you passed through earlier, pick up the pickaxe, plank, and tinderbox and choose collapse pillar on one of the pillars in the room to seal in the mother. (you must pickup the pickaxe and the tinderbox, even if they are on your tool belt, or you won't be able to collapse the pillar.) your plan goes amiss, however, and the ceiling caves in, killing you once more and sending you back to thefremennik spiritual realm. talk toeir, who says it's still not your time to be in the realm and she probably won't see you again until your real time comes. she sends you back to your companions in the main chamber, where you first found king vargas. back in the main chamber of the dungeon, you see the dead bodies ofprince brandandprincess astridon the floor. choose the check option on them. talk withbaba yagaandkoscheito learn what happened. baba yaga tells you the prince and princess didn't die in vain. koschei says he thinks he has died again. attempt to climb up the rope.brundt the chieftaincalls down, telling you to head to his boat as the fremennik offence is failing. on board his ship, talk with brundt about what happened. if you use a teleport to escape the dungeon instead of the rope, talk to brundt in rellekka, where he tells you he is waiting for you on waterbirth island. the quest then continues. you sail tomiscellaniaandetceteriaand watch a poignant cutscene whereking vargas,queen sigrid, brundt, and you launch and set fire to pyre ships bearing the bodies of prince brand and princess astrid. brundt and you then return to rellekka. congratulations. quest complete. speak to brundt three times after the quest to receive your experience rewards. blood runs deep is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: your marriage to princess astrid the mother is now at your mercy. princess astrid lies dead the player attempts to attack baba yaga, but she teleports."

the vampyre city. with help from an unexpected source, you must infiltrate the upper echelons of vampyric society to locate the last remaining blisterwood tree, which lies heavily guarded in the city’s dark heart and whose branches are the bane of even the most powerful vyrewatch. once you have done so, you’ll be able to create weapons that will end this looming threat before all is lost, and will put the myreque in a better position to end their war once and for all. you may defeat the foe that lurks in the shadows, and the rewards may be great, including experience tomes, new weapons and an item that teleports its bearer to the barrows, among other places, but will the end really justify the means? speak toveliaf hurtzunder the pub inburgh de rott. he will tell you that he needs help withvanstrom klauseand thevyrewatch, who are becoming stronger while the myreque grow weaker. he explains the situation thatthe myrequeand burgh de rott are in: the supply routes tomeiyerditchhave been cut off and the vyrewatch have discovered burgh de rott. they have even abductedmariusand brutally murdered him. ask what you can do to help (this starts the quest). veliaf will say he feels terrible about asking you, but he will explain thatcornelius(the town's banker) saw a shadowy figure digging south of the bank a few nights before, and that an entrance to something was unearthed there. no one has been down yet due to the danger, but it needs exploring. veliaf believes that the mysterious figure was vanstrom and that he might still be in the tunnels. he asks you to go down and explore, and to defeat vanstrom if you find him. go to the dungeon entrance south of burgh de rott bank and climb down. you will find yourself in a tunnel with a rope to the surface, a coffin, a blood drop symbol on the floor, a letter, a decaying tome and a fountain of blood. pick up theletter. it's addressed tosafalaan hallow, from someone called ""v"", who knew safalaan's parents and safalaan as a child. they mention that they have answers that safalaan seeks and to meet him in the clearing in the middle of sector four. there also is a decaying tome lying in the corner, with two readable pages. they are stained with blood making some pages unreadable, although one page mentions theicyene. inspect the coffin, and a small amount of blood will be spilt, dealing 10 life points of damage. in it is amedallionwith an orange symbol similar to that on the floor. report back to veliaf. if you mention the medallion to him he will tell you that it is the symbol ofdrakanand is of vampyric origin. he doubts that it was placed there by vanstrom as it is old and dusty. he refuses to take it from you, calling it evil. you will then show him the letter. veliaf will say it must have been placed there by vanstrom as it is too clean to have been there long. he thinks that by noticing vanstrom going into the cave, they might have ruined his plan to pretend to be a meiyerditch citizen. veliaf thinks that the plan is too subtle for vanstrom, and suggests that you take the letter to safalaan. he tells you it is too dangerous to enter meiyerditch the usual way and gives you a teletab to take them straight to safalaan. before sending you he will warn you that safalaan has been preoccupied and not himself lately. if you agreed to the teletab, you will be taken straight to the meiyerditch myreque hideout. speak tosafalaanat the north end of the hideout. he will ask how you got there and say the supply runners haven't been getting through from burgh de rott. tell him about the medallion. he will ask where you got it from. you will tell him about the cave and what veliaf said about it. when you show it to him, he will say it feels familiar and ask to take it from you. you will be shown handing it to him, where it will glow in his hands. he says he added a destination to it; the meiyerditch myreque hideout. he doesn't know how he was able to alter a vampyric artefact, and asks you to take it away from him. ask him what the vampyres have been doing and he will explain that tithes have been increased and any citizen unable to meet them is taken away to an unknown location, and that rogue vyrewatch have even been appearing and snatching healthier citizens. he claims that they seem restless and they're not following tithing orders. tell safalaan you have a letter for him. he will ask where from and you will explain the happenings in burgh de rott. he will take the letter from you and read it. ask him what he thinks and he will express disbelief and ask if you're sure it was vanstrom. you will repeat what you were told about the night the cave was uncovered. safalaan is dubious, as the letter speaks of his parents, experiences and his visions. go through the dialogue options. safalaan will explain that he doesn't remember much about his past, including being young or how old he is. he has also been having visions, and he feels that there is some greater power in him ready to be released, for good or bad. ask what you should do. safalaan says he will have to meet the letter's sender. he thinks vanstrom must know something, and that if he was truly after burgh de rott he would have simply attacked. you mention that it might be a trap and safalaan agrees. he says they can't give vanstrom what he wants, but they must still find out what is going on. he decides to send you in his place. he sendsvertida sefalatisandmekritus a'harawith you, and advises you to look from a window to the north of the clearing (which is west of the base) before meeting the contact. travel to the meeting spot, the blue square indicated on the minimap if the quest is set as active; exit the base, go through the wall to the north and climb up the stairs. jump the floorboards to the west and go down the ladder. open the door, exit and go west a bit, then south at the barricade. enter the building and open the door there in the room with the portrait. climb up the ladder. at this point, you will run into two of the rogue vyrewatch safalaan described. the first wants to take more than a tithe from you, but the second tells it to wait and says that you are ""the one"". the other agrees, calling you fresh and full of blood, and says that you'll ""have a worse time with her"". you ask them what they're talking about, but they fly off. now jump over the wall to the building to the west and climb down the ladder. open the door, exit and close the door. now go north and west around the next building. enter it and go east, where vertida will be standing. speak to vertida and he will tell you that mekritus is upstairs and that the wall beside him can be climbed to reach him. climb up the wall and speak to mekritus. mekritus explains that the window overlooks the meeting place and can be used to check whether the coast is clear. he and vertida will flank around to give ground support. click the white sickle logo on the ground to spy. a cutscene will play, showing vertida and mekritus in position when the informant comes out of a building: it's a crying, young girl callednessie. go downstairs and speak to nessie. nessiesays she saw you in the window and asks why it took you so long to come down, claiming the vyrewatch could have got her. she claims she knows your name because you're the great hero of the myreque. when asked, she explains that she's lost and a scary vampyre, vanstrom, told her to stay there. you say he's the worst vampyre besides drakan, but she laughs and says his power is nothing compared to hers. she then transforms intovanescula drakan. vertida yells for you to attack. do so and she will counter with what looks like a ring of smoke that throws you backwards and teleports your myreque companions away. you will then have an option to talk to vanescula. she will tell you to calm down and that she's not there to fight, and that you wouldn't be a challenge anyway (you may have to back away until out of sight of vanescula before you can leave combat posture.) when questioned, she says she's there to help. she planted the letter inburgh de rott(and is insulted about being mistaken for vanstrom). she knows about safalaan but says any information about him is between them alone. vanescula knows about the myreque's dream of defeating drakan and freeing meiyerditch. she sees no reason why that shouldn't happen, but thinks that the myreque aren't doing a good job by themselves. according to vanescula, she will help the myreque because she feels that lowerniel drakan is no longer a good leader, and he's spending more and more time shut in his castle obsessing over a rock. he hasn't noticed the influx of themercenary protocol, the threats frommisthalinor even the recent infighting amongst the vyrewatch, and vanescula thinks he is a blind fool who is letting the vampyric society fall apart. moreover, she is also bored. vanescula cannot kill drakan herself because she needs to command the respect of the vyrelords (although she claims to be able to do it easily). she claims that discoveries made through the study of haemalchemy mean that vampyres could survive without blood and so the citizens of meiyerditch could be freed if she was leader. vanescula says you should trust her because she hasn't killed you yet, and because she has claimed you as her personal blood tithe, so none of the vyrewatch will tithe you as you travel through meiyerditch. she also tells you about the vampyre citydarkmeyer, ""where your greatest weapon lies"". she tells you about theblisterwood tree, the mere touch of which harms vampyres, which could make a weapon more potent than theivandis flail(which she claims is merely a stick to the higher ranked vampyres) if it could be chopped from and the logs carved. she will give youa written offerfor you to give to safalaan. use the medallion to teleport back to the meiyerditch hideout with the letter vanescula gives you. take it to safalaan, who will be worried about you. he will be excited over the contents of the letter; vanescula knows about his past, a thing which has always been a mystery to him. you ask him to focus on vanescula's promises about helping them. safalaan will tell you to do as vanescula has suggested. he tells you to speak to vertida for advice as he will be busy pondering on the letter. speak to vertida. he is wary about trusting both vanescula and safalaan, as safalaan hasn't been himself lately. he thinks safalaan is so desperate for information that he isn't thinking clearly and is too quick to trust. he tells you about the huge walls of darkmeyer and how dangerous the city is and that it is impossible to enter, except by using a drainage gate along the uppermost wall in eastern meiyerditch that you may be able to climb under to access darkmeyer. he suggests taking some smoke bombs from the storeroom and a hatchet to cut the tree. he also reminds you to look for seeds to grow their own tree. take the 30smoke bombsfrom a crate west of the exit ladder. the fastest and easiest way to reach the drainage gate that leads to darkmeyer is to use the medallion to teleport to the meiyerditch laboratories. from meiyerditch laboratories, go up the stairs, through the slashed tapestry, and out of the building. from here run south-west along the diamond building (clockwise) and just run north until you reach the drainage grate. if you don't have your medallion, you can walk to darkmeyer by heading out of the myreque base, up the stairs and across into the next building. leave this building and run through the building directly to the north. turn right, then run north. once past the fish shop, turn left, and run north to the drainage gate. vanescula will meet you on the other side of the drainage gate. she tells you the tree is guarded in the upper tier of darkmeyer and that the darkmeyer vyrewatch are more independent than the meiyerditch ones. vanescula advises you to use the smoke bombs to find a disguise to fool the juvinates, but to avoid the vyrewatch who will be able to smell you. she says to come back to her once you have a disguise, and she gives you a needle and some thread to alter your disguise to fit. use the smoke bombs only when out of sight of thevampyre juvinates. do not go nearvyrewatch. search chests inside buildings (marked on the map below) to find clothing. if caught you will be teleported back to vanescula. (although it is possible to combat the juvinates, it is difficult to initiate combat and is probably not worth it.) try to get to a building before your smoke shroud vanishes. once in a building, immediately close the door and move to the back of the building. this will keep any vampyres outside who were on their way to teleport you away, though they may wait until you re-emerge and teleport you away in any case. look for vyrewatch or juvinates that match your movements, as they will try to catch you as you leave. if you do spot a vyrewatch or a juvinate that is waiting for you, you can exit to the lobby and they will move on. once you've found, fixed and equipped all four pieces of theoutfit(hood,torso,trousersandboots) yourtitlewill change tovyrelingand the vampyres will be a bit nicer, at least not throwing you out. return to vanescula. she will cover your human scent with her own and explain how to get to the blisterwood tree. to get to the arboretum with the tree you need to be a respected vampyre. to do this you must raise your status in darkmeyer. head north east through the low-tier to reach the middle-tier, where vanescula will be waiting for you. you will be asked what your name is bysentinel mortshadeorsanguinus varnis. make one up from the options given. this will be your vampyre name. talk to the named vampyres to get tasks from them. completing these earns rating. when half of the rating bar is full you can enter the upper section and you can access the arboretum when it is three-quarters full. tasks include: once you have enough status speak to vanescula and she will tell you to enter the arboretum. she will warn you once again to watch for ranis. ranis will stop you as you run towards the doors. he will question you as to whether you think vanescula, whom you pledged allegiance to, is more important than he is. he will demand that you pledge fealty to him as well. when you do so, the bloodmark will cause you pain. ranis dismisses you but warns you that he'll be watching. check the health of the blisterwood tree. you're told that the tree needs to be given sequences of energy in the correct order. the first sequence is water, then light, then nutrition. pull the lever on the machine. several glowing circles will fill the first three rows of the tray next to the lever. you must get it so each row contains one of each colour, starting from the top. the circles are moved by clicking on the bottom left one of a group of four, which will rotate the four circles clockwise. there are 4 sets of circles, bottom left, top left, bottom right and top right, each one in a group of four. note: the circles can be right-clicked if the player cannot distinguish the different colours. for some, changing the skybox to ""shattered worlds"" also makes it much easier to visually distinguish between the colours. note: some players report a glitch where the game freezes upon pulling the lever. if this happens,  press the escape key to close the overlay, and if that doesn't seem to do the trick, simply adjust your graphics to minimum for the puzzle portion and then swap back. make sure you also turn off loading screens. you may need to restart the game between each puzzle. this should clear the glitch and allow you to progress. align the circles so that: pull the lever and check the tree again. this time the tree needs nutrition, water, light, nutrition. pull the lever again to get more circles, which are moved in the same manner as before. align the spheres so that: check the tree a third time. the instructions are more complex this time; no water can touch another water, or nutrition another nutrition, diagonally, vertically or horizontally. water and nutrition may touch each other and light may touch anything. one solution is as follows: for the fourth and last infusion of energy, light and water may not touch in any way, light can touch light, water can touch water and nutrition can touch anything. one solution is: you can now chop the blisterwood tree. this will attract the attention of ranis. after you've chopped three logs in a row, he will demand that you come out of the arboretum, while changing to his vyre form. vanescula will come over in her vyre form and ranis will tell her that he doesn't think you're really one of them. the screen fades to black and ranis' corpse is shown on the floor with vanescula standing nearby. leave the arboretum and speak to vanescula (you can chop more blisterwood logs first, if you wish; they can be used to make additional stakes). she says she'll blame the death of ranis on you (meaning the myreque), but that it had to be done; he would have exposed you otherwise. she also says that the tree produces no seeds, and that vanstrom knows where the myreque hideout in meiyerditch is. she demands the medallion off you. she restores its full potential and hands it back to you, adding a teleport back to darkmeyer and the barrows to it. she will teleport you away, to just outside darkmeyer to bring you into safety while she explains what happened to the vampyres. go back to the myreque base. you can use the medallion to teleport to meiyerditch to appear there (will not use a charge because it's within morytania). speak to vertida to find out that safalaan has been missing since shortly after you left for darkmeyer. vertida calls a meeting to discuss what you've discovered. kael remains suspicious of vanescula throughout the meeting. you inform the myreque that vanstrom knows the location of the base. vertida calls the myreque to evacuate. kael and mekritus say that they're tired of running and hiding and wish to fight. vertida agrees with the majority and says they must take the fight to vanstrom and enter darkmeyer. it is decided that because you're recognised amongst the vyre ranks as a respected member of vampyre society, you must go alone. speak to vertida to learn how to make blisterwood weapons. he advises you to make one for each combat style, and to get two silver sickles from kael. only if you do not have a knife in your tool-belt he will offer you a knife. use it on the a set of blisterwood logs you collected and make a blisterwood polearm, a staff and some stakes. you have to make all three weapons, otherwise attempting to enter the final boss house will result in a message saying, ""this looks far too dangerous for now."" to completeraising the stakes, one ofhard morytania achievements, the polearm needs to be fletched on the surface - the myreque hideout does not count as being in morytania. you will also be given a bottle of holy water which he says will be of use against a vampyre's mist form and the bloodveld minions vanstrom is known to make use of. he also suggests you ask the other myreque for advice on fighting vanstrom. kael can tell you about vanstrom's darkness attack, which he once witnessed being used on a vampyre juvinate. mekritus will warn you that vanstrom will turn into mist when severely weakened. teleport back to darkmeyer and bank with the darkmeyer treasurybank chest. make sure to have a super potion set, extreme set or overloads, lots of food (preferably rocktails - and many of them), your best armour, the holy water anddrakan's medallion. something to restore run energy is highly recommended, but not always necessary at higher agility levels (or if the player visits theoo'glog spabeforehand). a spirit terrorbird and scrolls is very helpful as it can also carry more food. if you wish you may speak tovanesculaagain on your way to vanstrom's house (look for the biggest house), which is just south east of her. once you enter the house you will be attacked byharold, a level 98bloodveldpet. this fight should be no trouble for you if you have decent armour and combat stats. to defeat him, you must throw the holy water given to you byvertidaover him. it is advisable to take a better weapon than the blisterwood polearm to defeat harold first, and then go back to the bank and get more supplies. a good weapon may also be useful later for the bloodveld summoned by vanstrom. if you die in the house you keep both your medallion and the darkmeyer disguise, which means that you can easily teleport back to your gravestone, which will be just outside the house. this makes death only a ""minor"" issue. there is also an altar in the city if needed. the disguise doesn't need to be brought for this battle. equip your best armour at burgh de rott bank, so that you start with full life points. ranging armour is a good choice, since it gives some protection against vanstrom's magic attacks, while you can attack with the blisterwood stakes (cut extra logs if needed so that you have about 100 stakes, or fewer if you useava's accumulatoror similar). then teleport back to darkmeyer and if you run straight to vanstrom's house you will take only minor damage from vyrewatch. go through the metal door at the other end of the entrance hall andvanstromwill be waiting. he will tell you that he wants to killsafalaanas he is half-icyene with considerable powers, and thank you for previous events such as bringing him to the myreque hideout and rebuildingburgh de rott. he then attacks you. make sure to equip your armour and drink your potions before entering the room. after the aforementioned dialogue,vanstromwill attack you in his human form. attack him with your chosen weapon, preferably theblisterwood polearm. after a few hits he will transform into his vampyric form and become much more powerful. vanstrom's vampyric form is level 140. players that have at least level 80+ in a combat stat, and the consistent use of abilities, shouldn't find the fight very difficult. continue attacking vanstrom with your chosen weapon, with protection against/deflect melee on, to reduce the damage of his melee attacks. protection against/deflect magic works against vanstrom's distance attacks. vanstrom uses melee attacks when possible and otherwise magical, red energy balls; both styles are capable of hitting around 250 life points. vanstrom also has an arsenal of deadly special attacks, which he will constantly use during the fight at random. the darkmeyer disguise and drakan's medallion are always kept upon death, so reaching your gravestone shouldn't be a problem. your grave will appear just outside vanstrom's house. in addition to his magic and melee attacks, vanstrom has a number of special attacks which he will commonly use against you. protection prayers have no effect against these special attacks. when vanstrom moves to the centre of the room and yells, ""stare into the darkness!"", you should do the exact opposite and run to a wall facing away from vanstrom or be hit for up to 4000 damage. this damage is reduced if faced the opposite direction and running. you must also turn the camera to face away from him. there is very little time to react to this, probably just over a second, so be on guard. because of this, you may want to turn your camera angle to face vanstrom's back, so that if he does use this technique, you don't have to worry about turning your camera angle and just focus on turning your character away. this attack can be mitigated if you can move your camera around with your mouse. to do this, simply hold down the scroll wheel button and move your mouse around. this is a lot faster than using the arrow keys. one way to handle this special is fighting him near the centre (if you are using melee), with your back facing the door where you entered from. as soon as he says his special, run to the door and when you stop, heal and wait. sometimes this avoids all damage, and sometimes you will be hit only for 500-1000 damage, instead of the usual 4000. if you stay with this method, this avoids you trying to run both or other ways as sometimes he will use it again right after he finishes this special giving you little to no time to get to the opposite wall, and you will be hit even higher the closer you are to him. if not using the door tactic, you will have to react very quickly to which way he is facing, so sticking with one spot usually guarantees a 50/50 chance he will face your way and all you have to do is heal. vanstrom will teleport you into the middle of the room and spawn a ball of blood under you when he yells ""let the blood consume you!"". run away from the spot you are standing on or be hit for high damage. if you can manage to lure vanstrom to this spot, he will take the damage. vanstrom will also follow up with a melee attack. as you run from the blood spot vanstrom will chase you and strike at least once with a melee attack. as you are running if you quickly switch to protect/deflect melee you can reduce this damage considerably. it is advised to switch back to protect/deflect magic afterwards. like the darkness special attack, quickly run to a corner of the room and heal. most of the time this avoids all damage and if you are unlucky you will be hit for the reduced damage which is usually around 500-1000 (this only happens if you didn't go there quick enough). just make sure to heal so your health is over 5000, as when completely unavoided, this attack is capable of hitting very high, up to 6000. this can be one of the most deadly attacks as vanstrom may spam attacks one after the other with no time to heal between. a sequence of four or more attacks can kill a player with 99 constitution with a life points boost. during the fight on a few occasions vanstrom will run to the centre of the room and yell out ""come, fiends, and aid your master!"", which summons 2 smallbloodveld leecherswho will heal him if not killed quickly. they are relatively weak and have only 1500life points. they move slowly and spawn in the opposite sides of the room from each other. try hitting them once, or get their attention to prevent vanstrom from healing if they get too close. should they reach him, they will die and heal vanstrom. he keeps attacking you normally while you are busy dispatching the bloodveld. it's possible to win without killing the bloodveld; you will just need to do some extra damage to compensate for their healing. at several points during the fight vanstrom will launch himself into the air and throw balls under you similar to the blood pool attack that can hit for high damage (up to 4000+ but usually around 2000). he will throw a bomb approximately once every 2 or 3 seconds. in addition, he will occasionally freeze you to the spot. this only lasts for a split second. quickly click somewhere else on the floor. the bomb will damage you if it explodes under or one square adjacent to you (the latter does not reduce damage). vanstrom will not throw bombs for a second or two when he starts flying, giving you some time to start running. to avoid damage, run in a circle around vanstrom until he lands. vanstrom will be flying in one spot, occasionally moving to another. you will deal heavy damage (often over 5000) to vanstrom when attacking in the air, by both melee and ranged blisterwood weapons, making this a great opportunity to deal quick damage and shorten the battle. if trying to attack vanstrom during the blood bombardment attack, make sure that you never stand still - immediately after clicking to attack, continue to run your pattern avoiding the blood bombs. it is very easy if done correctly, you take no damage if you keep moving. do not run back into harold's room to try to escape the blood bombardment. vanstrom can still launch these attacks against you in harold's room, even though the door is closed. when vanstrom is low on health he will turn into vapour, akin tomistand become immune to attacks. at this point he will stop running and move at a normal speed. you need to lure the mist at least partially into the tiled area in the centre of the room. the mist will be reluctant to move directly, you will need to stand inside of it to spark movement. then throw the holy water with left-click, which will form a large pool of water in the middle. so long as vanstrom is above the water, he will be damaged. if you get too close to him, he will use quick magic-based attacks on you but the damage is much lower, around 60 usually, hitting once every game tick. a pool of water only lasts for a few seconds and must be constantly renewed. repeat this until he loses all of his life points. upon vanstrom's death he will exclaim ""you have me, but i won't be going down alone!"" in the middle of the room, fall to his knee and explode, hitting you for a near death damaging amount of life points while also summoning eight level 98bloodveld guardiansaround him. at this point you will take a large amount of damage that will cause you to faint. if you are wearing a ring of life, it will teleport you out of the fight at this point. you will have to return to the house and will not have to re-do the entire fight. you will enter with the bloodveld guardians still there, and will take the large amount of damage again and faint. you will faint because of the damage, but luckilyvanesculaandsariuswill enter the room. while sarius protects you, you willtake controlof vanescula to kill thebloodveld guardians. they will attack but never damage vanescula since she is a vampyre. you cannot attack them directly, only through the attack style menu using a series of special attacks; dart deals high damage to all bloodveld lined up, shadow stalk deals very high damage to one bloodveld and shriek deals average damage to all nearby bloodveld. it is recommended to use the shriek attack repeatedly as soon as it recharges. once the bloodveld are defeated, vanescula will blow up vanstrom's desk to destroy his information on the myreque. she says that you must be brought back to meiyerditch when sarius comments that she can do it for she knows the location of the myreque hideout because her fathermauritysused to be amyrequemember. vanescula will be angry at first but then praise sarius for her courage. sarius will take the unconscious you to the myreque hideout in meiyerditch, where you will wake up next to mekritus. go to vertida and speak to him. he will congratulate you on defeating vanstrom, and will show a cutscene where safalaan leaves meiyerditch, when he is stopped by several vyrewatch. vanescula shows up and sends them away. safalaan tells her that he is heeding her warning; she assures him that once he returns from his task they can ""begin"". vertida sends you to see veliaf in the basement of the pub in burgh de rott as there is nothing of value in meiyerditch with which you can be rewarded. teleport to burgh de rott with your medallion, go to themyreque hideoutunder the ruined pub in burgh de rott, and talk to veliaf. explain to him that you've killed vanstrom klause to which veliaf responds that vanstrom's and ranis' deaths have put the myreque into greater danger for the vampyres now consider them an actual threat. he reconsiders, and says that they may be closer than ever to destroyingdrakanwith two of his strongest vampyres gone. congratulations, quest complete! the branches of darkmeyer is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: additionally: vanescula's different special attacks "

totzhaar-mej-akortzhaar-mej-jehin the main plaza oftzhaar city. they inform you that the tzhaar race is dying, because onlyga'al, which do not inherit the memories of their ancestors, are hatching from the eggs. mej-ak and mej-jeh wish you to take more ga'al to theelder kilnto infuse them with the memories held in a dead tzhaar'stokkul, as you did before withga'al-xox. specifically, they wish for you to resurrect some of the greatest champions in tzhaar history so that they can live again. as you talk with them more they understand your reluctance to do it due to the pain it brought ga'al-xox inthe elder kiln, but they ask you to do it anyway, for they believe that the ga'al are mere abominations and the tzhaar race is on the brink of extinction due to the volcano cooling. mej-ak suggeststzhaar-mej-gek, one of the wisest and most powerful magicians in tzhaar history, and mej-jeh suggeststzhaar-ket-tegandtzhaar-xil-kal, excellent guard and hunter and formidable in thefight pits. they give you acommunication orb, which you may use to find the tokkul of the three named champions, and ask you to also round up three ga'al wandering around the city and send them to the main plaza. while searching for tokkul, you will likely come across somega'al, standing idly by in several locations. speak to those that you come across, and have them head to the plaza. thecommunication orbmay also be used to find the nearest ga'al. while there are more than threega'alwandering around the city, the following are three locations where they may be found: you may use the communication orb to locate the champions' tokkul. their locations are given below. mej-gek's tokkul is found at the northeast corner of the city, at thebirthing pool. as you approach, a cutscene plays, of the birth ofga'al-jehbytzhaar-mej-het. as it hatches, mej-het becomes angry that it failed again and sends the ga'al to die in the pits. go to the north of the pool and speak to mej-het, who was paid with thetokkul of tzhaar-mej-gekfor charging a human adventurer's staff. he then gives you the tokkul, and says that he needs to take care of the eggs, despite the fact that half of them die and the other produce only ga'al. fragmentsof ket-teg's tokkul must be mined from the statue of tzhaar-ket-teg, on the east end of the city in the tunnel that leads to the fight kiln. the player receives five fragments, which must be taken to thelava furnacein the south-east corner of the main plaza in order to reform them into one piece, thetokkul of tzhaar-ket-teg. xil-kal's tokkul must also be obtained by miningfragmentsfrom the statue of tzhaar-xil-kal at the entrance of the city (to the south). forge the fragments into thetokkul of tzhaar-xil-kal, just as you did previously. return to mej-jeh and mej-ak. the three ga'al are also there. they say they're heading out to the entrance to the elder kiln. use tokkul-zo to teleport to fight kiln, pick the quest option at the cave entrance. you meet withtokhaar-hokinside the elder kiln (the tunnels are bypassed). mej-jeh and mej-ak request that the ga'al be transformed into tzhaar, but tokhaar-hok says they are too weak, and that the tokkul is simply ""lost"" in the sacred lava, to be reborn as tokhaar. afraid of losing the tokkul, mej-ak asks you what to do. no matter what you choose,ga'al-xoxsuddenly enters and slays mej-ak before anything can be done. enraged, mej-jeh berates him for murdering a tzhaar on sacred grounds, but ga'al-xox simply explains he cannot allow any more ga'al to be tortured like he was. he then flees with the champions' tokkul. mej-jeh sends you after him and you appear outside the kiln. activating the communication orb here and choosing option 1 tells you to go south and then to the far east. the cave entrance you need is on the eastern edge of the city map. ga'al xox appears. ga'al xox kills tzhaar-mej-ak. ga'al xox is not happy. ga'al-xox flees out of the kiln and through the city, ending up in a cave to the far east end of the city. activate thecommunication orbwhile standing in front of the cave entrance, then enter the cave. entering the cave begins the combat portion of the quest, and followers cannot enter. progress is saved upon the clearing of each room, meaning you can leave to restock if you wish or need to. there is atzhaar-ketbanker just outside the entrance of the first cave. you have to activate the communication orb to make the banker show up (and/or enter the cave and then exit it). the following areas are safe; no items are lost upon death (apart from any food or potions you've already consumed). the player will respawn by the bank at the entrance to the cave with all items and armour.(spoiler alert: this cave is the entrance to thefight cauldron, accessible upon completion of the quest). note:tzhaar mej-jeh comments at the beginning of each room. combat may be postponed while listening to him. as the gate closes, the security system begins to summon monsters. this first room of this cave contains fourtz-kih, which are weak to stab. however, it may be best to kill them with ice spells from theancient magicksto prevent them from draining your prayer points. as they are weak, anything can be used to kill them. at the far end of the cave are twoancient scalesand three weapons, anobsidian mace(found on the floor adjacent to the western scale),obsidian sword(on the western scale), andobsidian knife(on the eastern scale). remove the sword from the western scale and replace it with the mace. remove the knife from the eastern scale and replace it with the sword. the scales drop into place, and the gate opens. inside the next cave are two water-weaktz-kek, followed by another tz-kih and a slash-weaktok-xil(which appear after all tz-kek have died). once these enemies have been dealt with, activate the communication orb and mej-jeh will comment that there is a bookcase with reading orbs at the other end of the cave. search it and mej-jeh will discover that these tunnels are ancient and important. in fact, the first tokhaar to escape the kiln to become tzhaar created this tunnel system. as such, it is directly connected to the elder kiln. it also speaks of a ring of living fire, tzkot-zo, which mej-jeh cannot remember from his previous lives. solve the puzzle by moving the statues into the combat triangle; the tzhaar-ket facing the tzhaar-xil, who is facing the tzhaar-mej, who in turn faces the tzhaar-ket. arrows appear on the ground to help you; these turn purple as the statues are positioned properly. the puzzle is not difficult to understand conceptually, but it can be tricky to align the statues properly. it may help to position the statues in as small a triangle as possible. statues can be pushed diagonally. once the statues are properly aligned, the gate will open. the third room contains a grid floor over lava - reading the bookcase reveals it is the tzkot-zo. it is a special mechanism, connected to the kiln on both ends. it filters and purifies the lava before passing it on to the kiln. he remarks that it was constructed by neither the tzhaar nor the tokhaar. as soon as you pass through the hot vent door, some of the squares start glowing and several tokhaar appear to protect the sacred lava. the squares first glow a dull orange for a few seconds, and then turn bright yellow. at this point, any player standing on one takes rapid hits for heavy damage until they stand on a safe square, and any tokhaar standing on it rapidly heals. if not noticed quickly, it can be difficult to move off of a glowing square quick enough to avoid damage, so it is advised to stay at the corner of any given safe square. there are no safe spots, and any of the 9 metal platforms may begin glowing at any time. you must defeat the tokhaar while avoiding standing on the glowing squares. during the fight, it is advisable not to leave a monster alone for too long, as it may fully heal. it is also advisable to disableauto retaliate, as it may cause you to run onto a glowing platform. the first wave of tokhaar use melee and are weak to water. the second use mage and ranged and are weak to bolts and crush respectively. finally there is a singletokhaar-ket champion, with zero weaknesses and a high defence against allattack types. also, as inthe elder kiln, his melee attacks will drainprayer. abilitiesthat damage multiple enemies are useful when opponents are close together, especially on waves with several melee opponents. be cautious when using long-duration combo abilities as the square you are on might start glowing mid-ability. try to time these abilities so that you only use them when the squares have recently changed. the champion drops anobsidian maul, which must be placed on theancient scalesto open the gate. note:once you have finished the fight, if you leave the room to bank/replenish before you place the obsidian maul on the scale, the maul will be in the centre of the fight area. monsters do not respawn after you complete the fight. the fourth chamber contains four level 103tz-kils(lava monsters), which use magic and are weak to bolts. they hit quickly, so it is advisable to use protect from magic if you are using melee armour. kill them, go to the other end of the room, and pick up the obsidian weapons on the floor. there are four scales, each with a statue behind it. on each scale, place the obsidian weapon that is wielded by the adjacent statue. theobsidian macegoes on the northeastern pedestal, theobsidian throwing ringon the southeastern pedestal, theobsidian staffon the southwestern pedestal, and theobsidian swordon the northwestern pedestal. the gate opens. if there is trouble finding the correct weapon the minimap will indicate where each one is. the fifth chamber contains threetz-kih, then twotz-kil, and oneyt-mejkot. the tz-kihs shouldn't be difficult, but the tz-kil + yt-mejkot combination can prove a challenge. it is recommended to take out the tz-kils first, and then focus attention on the yt-mejkot. the yt-mejkot heals itself within melee distance, which makes it quite difficult even for higher-levelled players to fight using melee, but not impossible. if you are taking a lot of damage try luring the yt-mejkot over to the pedestals and trapping him on the south side while you safely range attack him from the north side. alternatively, you can use the corner of the south entrance to block the yt-mejkot while ranging the tz-kils. after killing all of the enemies within the area head north and touch one of the pedestals to start the puzzle. in this puzzle, you must click the pedestals in the order in which they light up. this must be done eight times, but the sequence is always the same each time. however, initially only one pedestal needs to be clicked, then two, then three, and so on to the full sequence of eight pedestals. if you ever mess up, you must start again from the beginning. if you happen to forget what order you must touch the pedestals, the proper sequence is: southeast, northwest, southwest, northwest, northeast, southeast, northeast, and southwest. the gate opens. the sixth chamber contains another sacred lava conduit node, similar toroom 3. here, you must fight fourtokhaar-hur, then twotokhaar-xil, then twotokhaar-mej, and finally twotokhaar champions, while avoiding standing on the glowing floor platforms. as before, the glowing floor heals the tokhaar. once the fight is over, pick up theobsidian mauland place it on theancient scalesto unlock the gate. from this point on, thecommunication orbfails to function, as it is out of range of the city. you will not be able to read the manuscripts on the bookshelves (as you do not know how to translate thetzhaar language), nor ask for advice on the puzzles. you are attacked by a bunch oftz-kekupon entering. you can use theancient scalesup ahead to block them or just have them block each other while firing magic at them. alternatively, they are fairly easy to melee, especially using multi-target sweep abilities. when that's over with, pick up the weapons lying around, as well as thestone tablet, and head toward the scales. the tablet is conveniently written in a language readable to the player, and provides translations for the inscriptions on each of the scales near the gate. the player must place the correct weapon on each scale, matching the inscription with the weapon type. the correct sequence varies from player to player. the interpretations for each scale are as follows: once complete, the gate opens and you may proceed to the next room. this room begins with threetz-kil. once these have been dealt with, enter twotz-keksand the loud arrival of aket-zek. 
userangeto kill the tz-kil while edging your way northwest to the divider wall ahead, so that when you kill the last tz-kil, you won't have the ket-zek spawn on top of you. if using magic: switch to magic gear and try to get the attention of the tz-keks from behind the wall, while keeping exposure to the ket-zek to a minimum until you remove the tz-keks. use theprotect from magicprayer when in view of the ket-zek to avoid taking more damage than you have to. if using melee: use theprotect from meleeprayer, and get the ket-zek to block the tz-keks. focus on taking down the ket-zek; this version is more powerful than those encountered in thefight caves. once he's dealt with, you can deal with the tz-keks as they spawn in, similar to the previous room. up ahead, nine (9) tzhaar emblems lie on the floor. rotate each emblems to form a large circular sigil like the one in the image to the right. when aligned properly, the gate will open. in the final room you finally catch up toga'al-xoxin another grid chamber, this one with a pair of valves and what appears to be a giant tap in the shape of a tokhaar's head looming above the area. ga'al-xox reveals the reason for the tzhaars' troubles: the tokhaar have shut off the flow of sacred lava from this chamber, which has cooled the tzhaar city and prevented the eggs from hatching properly. help ga'al-xox turn the valves simultaneously and reopen the flow of lava, which pours from the large tokhaar head down into the river of lava below. at this point,tokhaar-hokappears, expresses disappointment in ""his"" ga'al-xox, and challenges you to a battle. tokhaar-hok attacks with melee and drains prayer points with each hit. wear the best magic equipment possible, with the highest melee defence possible. however, it is also possible to fight with melee, wearing full tier-70 equipment or better.protect from meleeordeflect meleewill reduce considerable amount of damage taken. tokhaar-hok summons different waves of enemies –tokhaar-tok-xil,tokhaar-mej,tokhaar-xil,tokhaar-ket champion,tokhaar-ket, and finallytokhaar-hur; however, these additional summoned enemies do not need to be defeated, and it is possible to just focus on tokhaar-hok to finish this battle quickly. ga'al-xox also fights, attacking tokhaar-hok with ranged, but does not deal much damage throughout the fight. the lavafall on the north side of the field can deal damage equal 20% of the maximum life points of the player per 1.2 seconds; do not stay inside the lavafall, and immediately move off of any platform that is bursting lava. tokhaar-hok will attempt to retreat into the lavafall to regenerate, and ga'al-xox warns you to stop him. if he reaches the lavafall, he heals himself for 5000 life points every game tick. to prevent him from healing, use a stunning or binding ability on him. you need not wait for him to retreat to the waterfall; a great strategy is to stun him every 5 seconds or so if using magic, or as often as possible if using melee. if using melee, is recommended to put these abilities on your action bar and let them automatically activate. note that inlegacy mode, special attacks must be used to stun tokhaar-hok instead. it is recommended to use a weapon that has a special attack that requires less than 50% special attack energy; the zamorakian spear is an ideal choice. magic special attacks, such as that of the armadyl battlestaff, do not work. this fight can be made significantly easier if you space out stunning abilities with theentanglespell on your action bar. this works best with magic and is most convenient with revolution ++. it is relatively easy to stun-lock tokhaar-hok and end the fight quickly, taking very little damage. the list of stunning and binding abilities is shown below: note: barge does not work it is also a good idea to use paralysing spells from thestandard spellbooksuch asbind,snareorentangle. if he manages to heal inside the lavafall, he might say ""embrace the sacred lava!"" and teleport you inside the lavafall. run away from it immediately. spam clicking out of the lavafall is a good method, as he could teleport the player multiple times in a row. tokhaar-hok has no weakness, but players are advised to use magic during this battle, as ranged armour is weak to his melee attacks as well as those of the tokhaar monsters he summons. always be cautious of the lava squares – immediately move onto a safe square when they start to glow. the combined damage of the lava, tokhaar-hok and his minions can result in a quick death. player can also lure tokhaar-hok away from the lavafall, either by luring him to south side or stepping towards him if he is at the south side of player. as mentioned before, the battle is safe, which in turn means no items will be lost when dying. you spawn outside of the cave entrance, next to thetzhaar-ketbanker, allowing you to restock, rethink, and re-engage. this battle is quite difficult, but you'll start to understand the strategy more with each attempt. after defeating tokhaar-hok, talk to ga'al-xox once more and then head to the main plaza to meet with tzhaar-mej-jeh (the tokkul-zo may be used once outside of the arena). go to thefight kiln, and after a short conversation with the vanquished tokhaar-hok, ga'al-xox is fused withtzhaar-mej-ak's memories. tzhaar-mej-ak speaks through ga'al-xox and speaks of the intense suffering he experiences within the tokkul. after hearing confirmation of the torment from one of his own caste, tzhaar-mej-jeh relents and allows the remaining tokkul to be returned to the sacred lava and also vows to take care of the ga'al. ga'al-xox makes one final plea for the protection of the ga'al, and after saying goodbye, becomes one with the lava. in a ceremony afterward, you are made an honourary tzhaar. ga'al-xox is fused with the memories of tzhaar-mej-ak tzhaar-mej-ak speaks of what it's like to be tokkul. ga'al xox says goodbye as he becomes one with the lava. the brink of extinction is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

quest has remained in-game after the end of the event. unlike most quests, broken home is completely re-playable, with additional rewards for doing so. start the quest by talking tomaria, just outside of the huge mansion to the west ofpaterdomus, and close to the start of therag and bone manandmissing, presumed deathquests. you can reach her quickly using aninvitation box. she will tell you that a ghost is haunting her master's house and has killed most of the servants. she tells you thatingram, the owner of the house, has found something while exploring the levels below the basement and that he is still inside the mansion. she will ask you to enter the house to save him and the other servants. while inside the house, the world map will be replaced with the layout of the house with the location of the house's doors. some doors will be bolted and can be unbolted from the other side. always keep an eye out for grey smoke puffing out from underneath and around the bottom edges of doors, as a ghost namedormodis lurking on the other side. if the player enters through such a door, ormod will attack, dealing rapid damage. selecting to peek through the door is advisable; ormod will be present, but he won't notice the player and will soon leave. it is not needed to wait for him to leave; simply peeking at the door is enough to cause him to leave. it may be a good idea to always peek through the door because the smoke may not render on low graphics settings. alternatively, quickly entering and exiting through the same door will cause him to leave and any damage he deals will be prevented. there are various safe rooms in the house, which are save points for the quest. if you subsequently die or logout, your progress will be restored to your last save point. safe rooms also containcheststhat can be searched once formystery meat, which when eaten will restore your health completely. save the meat until you are very low on health. if thedefence capeis placed on theskillcape rackat theplayer lodge, then the perk will activate while the player is inside the house. otherchestsare also found throughout the house; these are sealed with a ""temporal magic seal"" the first time you play the quest, but can be opened and searched for tiers 1 through 9 xp lamp on replays, if you meet their skill-milestone requirements (10+ to 90+). the chest locations are also listed in a separate section below. upon entering the house, you will see aghostly waif(ghost girl) walk through a door. every door in the house is locked except for the first door on the west side downstairs; the one that the ghost entered. enter the door and you will reach thefirst safe room. search the chest for meat and enter the door to the north. walk into the west door to see a monster eat a servant and disappear back into the painting it came out of. pick up theclock handsand theraven keythat appears, go back to the safe room and use the clock hands on thegrandfather clock. you will receive aneye gem. go back north into the corridor and unbolt the eastern door to go back to the entrance hall of the house. go east and unlock the eastern, raven door. a cutscene occurs where you see anemaciated spirit(ghost boy) walking through a wall. go through the southern door and search the desk. you will find a note fromingramexplaining that the ghost is ormod's son and other facts about the ghosts. go east into the library where you will find apile of booksto begin a sorting puzzle. you must stack the books in a specific order. this order is random and different for every player, but after every combination, hints are given on which books are incorrect. start by stacking the books in any order, and click the ""check"" button. the hints will tell you which two bottom-most books are incorrect. the hints refer to the bottom book as the ""first book"" and the top book as the ""seventh book"", not vice versa. the easiest way to complete the puzzle is to keep swapping books in the first position until the hint no longer says that the first book is incorrect, then move on to next one. however, to make it faster, you can keep an eye on the second book from the correct part, keeping it in place if it is right and switching it out if it's wrong. after completing the puzzle, the books will fall and you'll find 2 eye gems. the tier-1 xp chest is in this room. after solving the book puzzle, walk back to the study and head north to the corridor. go through the eastern door into another corridor and go north. you'll end up in a corridor that has three doors, a staircase, and the tier-2 xp chest. enter the middle door to reach the hall of armour, where you must move the statues to reach the eye gem on thetableat the end of the room. the aim is to push all the statues to the sides so that they don't get in the way. if you make a mistake, you can right-click a statue to reset the puzzle. leave the room, and ascend the stairs at the end of the corridor, as the last set of doors will be locked. when you get to the top of the stairs, enter the eastern door that is just next to the staircase you climbed. you'll see the ghostly waif and emaciated spirit run through the door at the end of this corridor. take the door to the east into another corridor. enter the western door at the southern end of the corridor and searchingram's research noteson the floor, on the southern side. these notes will talk of ormod's madness and his attempts to cure it. when you are done reading, you will receive thespider keyand first part of the threescroll fragmentsof ormod's spell. leave the room, head north and through the western door, and through the next west door, back to the corridor with the staircase. open the southern door, unbolting it, and go through to reach the gallery above the grand hall. at this point you can go back to the first safe room in the first door to the west in the grand hall to save your progress (ground floor[uk]1stfloor[us], southwest door). after you enter the safe room and receive the prompt, exit the room, climb the staircase to the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]and go through the spider door to the west. you will enter a hallway; take the southern door, right beside you. you'll find adead servantlying in bed; search him and pry loose another eye gem. go through the west door to find a room with a sink. draw back thecurtain(the south border of the room) to reveal afaceless servanttrembling behind it. try talking to her and then search her for astatue key. return back to the dead servant's bedroom through the eastern door, then to the hallway through the northern door. enter the northern door on the west side, then enter the door at the end of this corridor. the emaciated spirit is in the middle of this corridor, and will disappear when you get close to him. enter the statue door in the middle of the corridor to find another eye gem and astatue. at this point you should have 6 eye gems. investigate the statue twice to insert two eye gems into its eye sockets, unlocking the western door. enter the western door. you'll find another statue here; investigate it twice, again, using two eye gems. this will open the southern door. enter the southern door, and investigate the third statue twice, using the last 2 eye gems. this opens the east door. enter the east room to find ascythe keyon the floor and another statue. like the previous three statues, the statue needs eye gems to open a door, but you won't have any left at the moment. there's an outline of a door here, but since the statue isn't activated yet, the door cannot be opened. retrace your steps out of the statue rooms and into the corridor. take the western door, through the southern door, and east back on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]mezzanine in the grand hall starting room. continue walking east on the second floor, past the staircase, and open the eastern door using the scythe key. behind the scythe door you'll find a corridor with 4 more doors (northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast). try to open the southwestern door; although this door is locked, you will have a conversation withingram, who will warn you not to enter the basement. open the southeastern door to find ashrineand a chest inthe second safe room. investigate the shrine for agrand piano keyand askull key, and search the chest for another piece of mystery meat. upon leaving the safe room you'll hear a scream; peek through the door to the west to see that something is blocking it (anotherdead servant). you'll have to go around: open the north eastern door, unbolting it, into the corridor with the room where you found ingram's research notes (first door). go through the far door up the corridor to the north west, then through the west door, to the corridor with the staircase. go down the stairs. the player needs to move through the next sequence of doors quickly, due to harming purple energy coming thoughbroken windows. you can run through the northwest door in the grand hall, as long as you unbolted it earlier; the next sequence will be slightly shorter, but this will not save your progress. quickly run to either of the doors on the west (the door to the south will let you save, while the door to the north is slightly quicker as long as you unbolted it earlier). if you entered the first safe room, go through the northern door into the corridor. go through the door to the north, unlocking it with the skull key. enter the door to the southeast to access ormod's study. searchormod's scribblingson the floor in front of you to find the second scroll fragment, then return to the corridor.if you don't do this, you will have to make your way back here through dangerous areas. optional:enter the north-eastern door to access a room with the ghostly waif. you can talk to and mimic her through the glass, but this offers no benefit. go through the northern door into another corridor. go through the western door to find thegrand piano. play it using the grand piano key to unlock a hidden panel on the southern wall. the player needs to move through the next sequence of doors quickly, due to harming purple energy coming through broken windows. to minimise damage, note that the player will not be damaged when a dialogue box is open. there are a total of 2 dialogue boxes that open when taking the gem from the skeleton. after entering the room, immediately click the skeleton. the player will run over, taking 1-hit from the purple energy. a dialogue box will open, saying that you searched the skeleton. click the yellow arrow on the dialogue box. a second dialogue box will open, saying that you found an eye gem. simultaneously, an eye gem will appear in your inventory. at this time, don't click the yellow arrow to close the dialogue box, but click the exit doorway. this does 2 things: prevents a misclick on the door, leading to longer exposure in the room, and limits the delay between closing the dialogue and clicking the door, possibly preventing the player from taking any damage while exiting the room. back into the corridor, go through the south-eastern door. this corridor has a door and a staircase. the door goes into the other side of the same room with the ghostly waif (who has switched sides of the glass panel). go down the staircase into the basement. you will now be in the basement. there are five doors: a southern door and a northern door on the western wall, a western door and an eastern door on the northern wall, and an eastern door on the eastern wall. there is also another set of stairs going down even deeper. if you want the xp chest, take the southern door on the western wall, which leads to a corridor. the south-eastern door in this corridor contains the tier-3 xp chest. go back the way you came, to the north. take the northern door on the western wall - there is adead butler. search him to obtain acleaver key, and exit again. the western door on the northern wall isthe third safe room, so head there to save your progress and open the chest to find some more mystery meat. exit again, and use thecleaver keyto open the eastern door on the northern wall. you will find yourself in a room withhaunted knife blocks, flying knives andbroken glass. enter the eastern door on the southern wall. toggle run off - if you run through the broken glass, you'll take heavy damage. the knives hit for 10% of the player's maximum life points, but they can be easily avoided even at walking speed. the last two sets of flying knives don't provide any safe spots, but are still passable. toggle run back on after you pass the last knife block. turn your run back on in this room. there are six doors: three on the northern wall and one on each of the other walls. the southern one is covered in dried ectoplasm, which you need to get rid of. enter the middle door to the north and search a chest of drawers to get alarge pipette, exit and then enter the north-eastern door. use the pipette on thepigto obtain alarge pipette of pig bileand exit the room. as you move through the eastern part of the room, the chair will rotate and track on you. occasionally, you'll see a flash of ormod sitting in it. enter the eastern room and search the furnace to findhuman ashes. exit and use the ashes and filled pipette on thecauldron, then use the pipette on the cauldron again to extract a pipette of thealkaline concoction, and finally use the alkaline concoction on the southern door with dried ectoplasm to make the ectoplasm vanish. enter through this door and the door will bolt behind you, preventing you from going back to the cauldron room. this corridor has three doors: two on the eastern wall and one on the western. enter the western room to find aservant frozen in placeand screaming endlessly; tear thedoll keyfrom her mouth, which will kill her. exit the room, back to the corridor. if you want the tier-4 xp chest, it's in the south-eastern room under some planks on the southern wall. in the corridor, enter the final, north-eastern room. search thekey hooksnext to the ladder to get thesnake keyto open the door to the grand hall at the top of the ladder. the player needs to move through the next sequence of doors quickly, due to harming purple energy coming though broken windows. head through the far western door in this corridor using the doll key, and ascend thestairshere to find the emaciated spirit in the nursery tower. optionally talk to him and he will say that he wants ""her"" hairbrush back. pick up thetusks key, descend the stairs and return to the corridor. enter the northern door beside you. enter the far door leading east, then proceed to the most eastern door leading south, unlocking it with the tusks key. inside the tusks room, investigate the bust to reveal a trapdoor underneath the southern stuffed bear. head down, and you'll find a small room with a dead thief. search the thief to find another eye gem. you should now have two eye gems which can be used at the last statue in the statue room to open a hidden door. climb back up the ladder, head back through the northern door and enter the middle door in the corridor. run through the statue rooms to the last one and investigate the final statue twice to insert the eye gems and unlock the hidden door. behind this room you will find another safe room containing theshrine of the son. investigate it and you will obtain themother's hairbrush. to get back to the nursery tower, return through the statue rooms to the corridor. go back to the west, south, then west and up the stairs. talk to the emaciated spirit. he will tell you that his name islenian- ormod's son - and that he believes his father is haunting the mansion because he blames himself for lenian's death. he suggests that he would go if he forgave him, but suddenly the ghostly waif will appear and consume lenian's spirit before warping into a monster. you will now find yourself at the bottom of the tower with the stairs destroyed and anoose keyin your inventory from the staircase's destruction. this point counts as a save point should you die later. be prepared to run before you proceed through the door to the east of you. move quickly. the monstrous form of the waif will begin following you. although it moves somewhat slowly, after passing through a door you need to move quickly, or it will spawn on top of you. if the monster touches you, you will instantly die - fortunately, this is dealt as soft typeless damage, so usinganticipationwill cause it to deal 90% of your maximum health as damage instead. like ormod, the monster will only appear in specific areas. head east out of the doll door, run east through the far door into the grand hall. the monster won't appear here, but move quickly because of the damaging energy. head to the eastern door on the northern wall. go through the door to the east, then quickly open the noose door immediately south of you (you only need to click on the door once). it will take time for the game to unlock and walk through the door; you're safe from the monster as soon as you get to the door. open the cupboard in this room and take the ladder within down to the basement. you will find yourself in a long corridor. run west down the corridor, then peek through the peephole in the northern wall to see symbols on a wall. then continue to the end of the corridor and go through the door. enter the north-eastern door to find yourself back at the bottom of the stairs that lead to the basement. optional:save your progress in the western door on the northern wall. proceed to descend the stairs. attempt to enter the only door, and you will automatically input the code seen from the peephole and enter the door. go down another flight of stairs and you will reach a door that is locked with pressure plates. move the three southernmost statues, and stand on the middle pressure plate. all of the plates will be purple and the door will open. the option on the statues is 'move' not 'push'; if you make a mistake and you need to pull a statue back, click on it. descend the stairs. the tier-5 xp chest is in the centre of this small corridor. descend another 2 flights of stairs to reach a pit with someclimbing gearnearby. click on the rope to climb down into the pit. you'll reach a safe room with the tier-6 xp chest to the south and a mystery meat chest to the north. go through the door to the east and you will enter a reception room. if you search themouldering tomenear the entrance, you will discover an ancient visitor's log that has your name on it. search the large reception desk to findnabor's notes on insanityand thechains key. head through the northern door and pass through a room and a corridor, and you'll emerge from a south-western door into a large room with a number of cells and a pit. the tier-7 xp chest is across the room on the left side. open the eastern door with the chains key and pass through it. pass through two more corridors until you reach another large room similar to the previous one. the tier-8 xp chest can be reached via walking on a plank over a chasm into the north east of the room. walk on another plank over a chasm to the south of the room to find yourself in a large, destroyed cell with thedagger keyinside. on low detail, the dagger key is quite difficult to see as it blends in with the tiles. you now have to head all the way back to theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us]. go back to the reception desk (west, west, north, west, south), and west back into the safe room (which will save your progress). climb back up the rope located on the western wall of this safe room. ascend three staircases, through the pressure plate door, up the stairs, through the symbols door, and climb the stairs. in the room with five doors, you can save in the western door on the northern wall. there are now two options to go to ingram's room, as this is the room that is marked with a dagger. the first option is more dangerous since you need to cross many corridors in which the monster spawns and you need to cross the grand hall which is still filled with the purple energy. the second option is safer, as the grand hall is not crossed (so the servant blocking a door to ingram's room doesn't need to be moved) and a fewer amount of corridors is crossed in which the monster spawns. you will now be in ingram's room — the monster won't spawn here — and you will notice that ingram has been killed by ormod. at the foot of the bed, searchingram's rantings, which explain that he disturbed the ghostly girl monster while exploring the catacombs under the house, and you will obtain the final fragment of thebreak curse scroll, which you can now combine with nabor's notes by clicking any of the 3 parts. you can enter the eastern door of ingram's room, which is also safe from the monster, to find the tier-9 xp chest. exit north from ingram's room and quickly run to the end of the corridor, then turn and use the scroll on the monster. it should stop moving. talk to the monster, and it will explain that he issenecianus aloysius pamphilius, ademonicresident ofsenntisten, and that he was driven insane by guilt after eating a young girl calledrowena, and then admitted into theasylumunder the house. in his insanity, he believed himself to be rowena wanting to play with people, but was confused when all his playmates disappeared as soon as he caught up with them. he will thank you for curing his insanity, and you will explain that you needed lenian to get rid of the murderous ghost haunting the house. he will say that he can get rid of ormod in one of two ways: he can either eat him, or take lenian's form and grant him the forgiveness he seeks. make your choice, and then run through the demon and through door to the west. on the bottom floor of the main hall, you will meet senecianus in the form of lenian. talk to ""lenian"", and he will then either forgive ormod - allowing him to pass into the afterlife - or devour him. exit the mansion and talk to maria outside for your reward. quest complete! the early bird bonus consisted of the following rewards and was rewarded to players who completed the quest within two weeks of its release: this quest can be replayed to earn severalone-time bonusesandchallenge rewardsas well as repeatableweekly rewards. after completion, the quest can be replayed for the following rewards: experience lamps can be found in thetemporal cheststhat you couldn't previously open in the house. each requires all of the player's skills (only requires skills released up to and includingdivination, and does not require levels in skills released afterwards, likeinvention,archaeologyornecromancy) to be at a minimum level, which is 10 times the tier of the lamp (so that the tier 1 lamp requires all skills to be level 10 each, tier 2 requires level 20s, and so on). the lamps can be used on any skill, including elite skills, although using them on elite skills yields only half the normal experience. make sure that you actually search the chest after opening it. the experience lamps give a total of 271,000 experience. the following locations are based on the in-game map: take note that these experience lamps may only be retrieved once. they will not reset for next week. although it is not listed as a distraction and diversion, this quest can be replayed weekly. once a week, maria will give the player alarge experience lampfor completing the quest again. ahuge experience lampis received weekly instead if the player has completed the three challenges at least once each (see next section). the activity resets at 00:00 utc wednesday, the same time as various other d&ds. after completing the quest, three challenges can be completed while replaying the quest. all three challenges can be completed in the same playthrough; however, all challenges must be done in order to be able to be completed. completing all three challenges is a requirement for themaster quest capeand for trimming thecompletionist cape. thepersistent ragerelic powercan be used to trivialise all damage in this quest, as it causes adrenaline to slowly increase when not in combat, which can then be turned into health by using theregenerateability. once all three challenges have been completed, the weekly replay reward is upgraded to a huge experience lamp. challenge rewards are

the hills, he's looking to recruit anyone eager to become a pirate and help him sink the enemy before he ends up swimming home. he's offering a lot more than a shilling to join his crew. have you got what it takes to be a pirate? travel toport phasmatysand speak tobill teachinthe green ghostinn. bill is the captain ofthe adventurous, a ship which he claims is the finest ever to sail the seas. he needs a pirate to help him leave the port, but none will sail with him, not even his crew. the night before, he had a heated argument with the captain of another ship, wherein the captain threatened to sink the adventurous and put his crew 'to the sword'. scared, all his crew members have abandoned him and he has no choice but to sail back to his home land. seeing his dilemma and wanting to be a pirate, you offer to help him. although he doubts your plundering abilities, bill accepts your help and tells you to meet him on his ship. go to the port phasmatys docks, and board the easternmost ship,the adventurous. speak with bill to set sail formos le'harmlessand begin your journey as a pirate. as soon as you leave port, you see acutscene, where an enemy pirate ship starts firing onthe adventurous, destroying the ship's hull and cannons. bill calms you down and tells you to first take care of the enemy's cannon. he suggests you grab some fuse and rope from the ship's lockers. search therepair lockerand take out fourropes, followed by procuring afusefrom thegun locker. climb up the ship's ladder to the main deck, and use the climbing net to climb up the main mast. use your rope on the hoisted sail ofthe adventurousto swing over to the enemy ship. failing the jump will completely deplete yourenergy. the rope is lost each time you travel from ship to ship. the ship is populated by level 26pirates, which are aggressive regardless of your combat level. if you need to escape from them for a moment, climb up the net on the main mast. find the cannon on the west side of the deck and use the fuse on the powder barrel next to it. light the fuse to blow up the barrel and the cannon. climb back on the main mast using the net, and using a rope, swing back over tothe adventurous. if you forgot to bring a second rope, you can find one in the south-west corner of the main deck of the enemy pirate's ship. now that you've controlled the offence, you need to build your defence. talk to bill and he'll want you to repair the damaged hull. climb down the ship's ladder and search the repair locker for 6repair planks, 30tacks, and 3swamp paste. each of the three holes takes two planks, ten tacks, and one swamp paste to fix. when you have enough resources, a message in the chat interface will say so if you try to get more than needed. for each hole, use a repair plank and then a swamp paste on the ship hull to patch it up. go talk to bill again. for attacking your ship, the enemy pirates need to be taught a lesson. bill asks you to pillage the enemy ship and bring back their booty. climb the net again, use a rope on the hoisted sail, and swing back over to the enemy ship. climb down the ship's ladder. steal from the chest to receive 5 enemyplunder, and then climb back up to the main deck, and return tothe adventurous. climb down the ship's ladder, and use your plunder on the plunder storage at the back. if you leave the ship, you will lose the plunder and have to steal it back over again. finally, bill wants you to prepare a send-off for the enemy and a blast from the cannon would do just fine. the aim here is to prepare and fire the cannon when the pirates are directly in front of it. climb down the ship's ladder, search the gun locker, and take acannon barrel. climb back up and left-click thebroken cannonto fix it (the cannon will have the option ""repair broken cannon""). talk to bill again, then go below and search the gun locker for aramrod, a fewfuses, and acannon canister. return to the main deck, and choose the take-powder option from the powder barrel next to the cannon. gunpowdercan be obtained from the powder barrel located right next to the cannon, just left click the 'take powder' option. be sure to check your chat box after firing, because the cannon hit may miss often. be sure to bring extra fuses as you will may need to fire more than once. if you miss, use the ramrod on the cannon to clean it out and then repeat the steps, until you score a hit. if you don't clean the cannon, it will explode from the previous unused gunpowder. if this happens, replace the broken barrel with a new one from the gun locker. when you hit the pirates with the canisters, talk to bill. he tells you to sink the enemy pirate ship by blasting holes in its hull; three would be enough. go down below, and search the gun locker to take at least threecannonballs; also take the same number of fuses (you may need extras in case the cannon misses or blows up). return to the main deck. clean the cannon out with a ramrod and then repeat the steps above until you have hit the enemy ship three times. take note of step 3 - when you fired the cannon the first time, you loaded a cannon canister. here, you should instead load a cannonball. following your third hit of the enemy pirate ship, you see a cutscene with bill teach talking withmama la'fietteinthe other inn. bill then thanks you and gives you alittle book o' piracy, to add

poison to weaken the airut, they get more than they bargained for. this quest can be started by talking totunks, who is on the northern end oftuska's back, which can be reached by talking towizard chambers. tunks explains his village,kanatahonmazcab, is under attack fromairutthat have been left by tuska. they are threatening to wipe out the entire village, and it seems the likely cause is the death of one of their chieftains. after speaking to tunks, head through theworld windowsouth of him to enter mazcab. from there, travel to the village of kanatah on the south-east side of thegoebie's homeworld and speak toacca kanatah. acca explains that thescoutshave spotted an amassing force of airut preparing to raze the village to the ground, noting also that this upcoming attack seems different to all the others they have witnessed. acca tasks you with seeking out tunks and his friends,peckandlunch. they have been tasked with collecting wood for the village, and will require guidance. to get to them, head directly east from acca, to the beach of the village. once you're there, speak to tunks. in this section and throughout the quest, you will take control of multiple goebies. you can switch between them by clicking on the goebie you wish to switch to. acca arrives and explains that more wood is required to fix the village, but her predecessor has stored a good stock of supplies and hid them away from the airut. however, these supplies are hidden in a ruin of obstacles and bottomless pits. lunch clears the way, and tunks heads inside, causing you to take control of him. jump over the chasm to the north and collect the bundle of logs. in the next room, use lunch to headbutt the wall to break it, and then squeeze peck through the small gap. collect the bundle of logs. after collecting the wood, talk to acca again to receive your next task. the village needs help finding a way to defeat the airut, but acca explains that whilenemi poisoncould be a solution, it is not in great supply. you need to go tonemi forestand search for a source of poison. nemi forest is on the west side of the mazcab area, past the slope towards the world window. enter the area, choosing the first option when prompted to head into the quest's instanced version of the forest. run a little north towards tunks and his friends and you will trigger a short cutscene. talk to theancient goebie. the group explains that you are there to findpoisonous nemi stalks, and that kanatah is at the risk of being overrun by the airut. the ancient goebie is happy to provide you with the root, however you must first save his friend from the temple to the north. try to enter, and lunch stops you, explaining the group needs to ""look the part"". after another short cutscene, the trio reveals their change of appearance and you head inside. talk toxinachto, who looks like a giant tortoise. xinachto explains he is a spirit guardian. when asking about the goebie trials, he replies that three young goebies must step forward and face the trials of their ancestors. according to xinachto, you can not face the trials with them, as you are not a goebie. return to the group, who you'll relay this information to. exit through the door to the west into another room, and you'll take control of the trio of goebies once more. in the room, there are 4 pressure plates on each side of a chasm and a cracked wall in the south-west. use lunch to headbutt the cracked wall on the south-west side of the room, and then peck to squeeze through. walk around the room to the northern side. read the glyphs to reveal the order of the pressure plates that lunch and tunks must stand on. from left to right on the southern side of the room, use lunch to step on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and then 1st pressure plates (in that order) to complete that row. be careful not to walk over any already activated plates when heading back to the 1st plate, as it will reset the puzzle. you need to use tunks to cross the chasm, as he is the most agile. now, from left to right, step on the 4th, 3rd, 1st, and 2nd pressure plates. use peck to investigate the magic at the north-east to complete the first trial. exit the room while in control of any goebie and the rest will follow. the east room is now unlocked, initiating the second trial.  enter the east room. leave the room the way you came. you can now head into the northern room, where the third trial awaits. for the instructions within this section, lunch needs to be placed in the correct positions after tunks. you can pull the lever as many times as you want to reveal the tiles. pulling the lever is not required to correctly activate the tiles with tunks and lunch if you'd rather just use the walkthrough below. this room is a bit more complex than the previous two. use lunch to headbutt the south-western wall, and send peck through to pull the lever. you will now use tunks to stand on a small tile in the centre and lunch to stand on its corresponding larger tile in the outer area. after pulling the lever one pressure plate will flip in the middle. this time, two pressure plates are flipped in the middle. using the same technique as earlier, just do both of them one at a time. this time, three pressure plates are flipped in the middle. this time, four pressure plates are flipped in the middle. leave the room the way you came in. upon leaving the room, you and the trio will speak to xinachto again, who explains that he is dying. lunch, not wanting xinachto to die, breaks his shackles, freeing him. leave the main chamber out of the southern door to return to the ancient goebie. as you explain the situation, it reveals the airut are coming and the goebies prepare to make a stand. for this part, you can click on the ground where you want the trio to attack. you will need to fend off the attackers using this method. if the trio all become injured twice, you will have to speak to the ancient goebie again to restart. the goebies restore health over time with ""i'm feeling a bit better now."" the chargers take one click to kill, while the actual airuts take two and tuz can survive 5 hits (4000-5000 magic damage is dealt per goebie attack). the first wave consists of the chargers, which are miniature dog-like versions of the airut.
the second wave consists of both the chargers and the airut. they can both quickly overwhelm your group, so keep them at bay. the third wave now consists of everything in the last two waves, this time also including tuz and ranged airut, which can overwhelm the three even faster with their ranged attacks. as the monsters will spawn out of their attack range but not out of yours, angle your screen facing south and zoomed out so you can spam-click ahead of the monsters before they hurt the trio. for greatest convenience, you may allow your wave to fail the first attempt to identify what side the monsters spawn, then on second attempt spam-click those spawn locations. as you progress through the waves, your progress is saved and you will continue from that wave when you retry. after the three waves are complete, speak to the ancient goebie to receive thepoisonous nemi stalks. return to acca back in kanatah whichever way you see fit. acca will thank you for helping the village, and reward you. congratulations, quest complete! call of the ancestors is not currently required for any quests or miniquests."

carnilleans duringhazeel cult, the carnilleans will gladly accept you, but if you sided with the cultists, xenia will reveal that she has used trickery and deceit for ceril to trust you. regardless of the option you took in the previous quest, locate ceril in his room in the western part of theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us]of the mansion and ask about the job. he will say that henryeta and he are growing older and need an heir, but their sonphilipeis rather snobbish and not much of an adventurer. hence you are needed to create a quest for him to complete, using only materials from the house. the quest is to be set in the carnillean sewers under the mansion. he will hand youa listcontaining a number of tasks to do. do not forget to ask where you can get the stuff from, otherwise you will not be able to continue. after you have spoken to ceril you need to talk tobutler crichton,butler jones's replacement, who will tell you to search a bookcase for abook about the carnillean family. it is located in the room withhenryeta carnillean. then go into the basement, and into the cave near the ladder. upon entering the cave system a cutscene will play.butler crichtonwill explain to the player what to do. inside the tunnels, you will see various things that can be built. right-clicking them will show what items are needed for them to be constructed. now head back to the house to gather some resources. in the master bedroom: in philipe's room: in sarsaparilla's room: animal skullsandbone scrapsfor the pit and decorations are taken from the spoil heap pile in the western corner of the small cavern located southeast of the goblins where the juvenile wolves are found. all of the hotspots will periodically sparkle, which will help you identify them as you proceed through the quest. asking butler crichton about the list will let you know exactly what you need to finish as he will also go in details about how to finish the task. to leave the cave, right click on the butler and select ""exit"". the entrance hotspot in the cellar (cobwebs around the entrance of the cave) requires: you have two options for the pit: talk to the two goblinsnostrilliaandslimepits. nostrillia will only agree to help you if you give her human armour. offer the armour taken from the wardrobe and ask them to play the role of the guards. after a long dialogue they will walk to the guard hotspots. they do not have to be built there. after the goblins have been set up as guards, you can build tripwires in the nearby hotspots. you will need twine to do this. you may want to construct the trip wire as the last thing you do, as it is quite tedious to cross each time. build the trip wire only after the dragons, the damsel, and the jailer are all built. go to the cellar and ask the chefclausfor help. tell him that he is to be the ""drunken jailer"" and he agrees but only if he gets to drink ceril's fortified wine. you should have taken it already, if not it's in the cupboard near the oven. lead him to the part in the cave before the bridge over the water and ""build"" him in the ""jailer"" hotspot. enter the cave in the southeast part of the dungeon to find twojuvenile wolveshunting acave mouse. grabbing the mouse will cause the wolves to follow you closely. lead them to the dragon hotspot and build it to position them. the dragon hotspot is across the bridge from claus. use a dragon head on each wolf to finish. speak tosarsaparillaand ask her to help. when she refuses, ask if she is going to stay up there all day. she then reveals she always wanted to be an actress after watching a performance. tell her that you're making a play and you want her in it, and you'll be given the option to give her a role. the role that she should be given to her is the fourth one, a ""damsel in distress"". take her to the room with the dragon guards, and ""build"" her in the damsel in distress hotspot. use the twine on her to tie her up. you must make a choice for philipe's ""reward"" for doing the quest using one of the two items (doesn't matter which): the decoration hotspots give you three choices: blood stains (red paint), scary eyes (red paint and wooden boards), or impaled skulls (animal skulls and spikes). it doesn't matter what you choose, but one of each will impress philipe. he will not be impressed by repeated decoration. there are three hotspots to decorate: once you have the scenario completed, talk to philipe and offer the quest, he will tell you that he overheard his parents and he knows the plot, thus not being very cooperative with you. pickpocket him and you will get his bag of sweets, now offer the quest again selecting the reward as the bag of sweets, he will reluctantly agree to do it. to complete the quest, philipe will need: a funny moment occurs while philipe tries to sneak past the guards; after he gives up, talk toslimepits. as soon asbutler crichtonnarrates, wait for a few moments. do not go forward with the dialogue or philipe will not be able to bypass the guards. once philipe slays the ""dragons"", thecave wolf matriarchwill appear. philipe will tell you to distract the matriarch so that he can kill it. to do this, simply click once to attack it, and it will immediately shift its attention towards you. philipe cannot die during the quest, and appears to take no damage from the wolf's magical attacks. the wolf has two attacks, both of which are dodged by running constantly. the first is an area-based magic orb that hits in the 200s to low 300s. the second is a howl attack that is harder to avoid, which causes stalactites to fall from the ceiling in a large grid, dealing rapid damage of around 50 to 100 (may be higher 500-600). as your health becomes lower, the amount of damage from the wolves attacks will lessen; therefore, the chances of death are very low, so no more than one or two pieces of food will be needed, if any at all.philipewill ""level up"" during the fight with the wolf causing greater and greater damage. a good technique is to lure the wolf to the bridge on the opposite side of the ""damsel in distress"" and trap it there. if the player stands back far enough on the bridge, the wolf will be unable to attack. the wolf will occasionally direct its attention to philipe, but simply clicking the wolf will bring its attention back to you (even if you're standing a few steps away). another technique would be to run circles around the wolf until philipe kills it, as the magic orb won't do damage if you are out of its area of effect, and most if not all of the stalactites will miss you. the 'dragons' and the damsel in distress fighting the 'dragons'. the matriarch arrives! philipe bravely fighting the matriarch. getting the girl. philipe is thankful for your quest. oncephilipehas defeated the wolf, talk to him and you will be shown a short cutscene of his rescue ofsarsaparilla. following this scene, you will be teleported back to the main floor to where your character will be rewarding philipe for the completion of his first quest. speak with philipe and a cutscene follows wherecerilhears how the quest went. while speaking to ceril,xeniawill teleport back to the entry place of the mansion. speak to xenia once more and she will reveal that she was the one that planned the entire wolf attack. amusingly, your character will be very frustrated when learning of this. speak to ceril one last time to finish the quest and to receive your reward. quest complete!  carnillean rising is directly required for the following

(if you don't have access to the tirannwn lodestone, you'll need to go back to the tyras guard at the catapult, then walk through some dense forest to the east and pass a tripwire, which may poison you, to reach the lodestone.) then pass north through theleaf trapto the bears and pawyas. to the west, search for a little path between the trees and past the sticks trap that leads south to the engineer. be careful of thestick trap! speak with the engineer and offer your assistance. read thecatapult schematicsyou get from the engineer to see what materials you will need, then talk to the engineer again and ask to see the letter. read the letter to find out what kind of materials you need. you will need: once you have all the parts, read the schematics and choose to make the repair parts. after making the parts, talk to the engineer and ask him to let you read the letter that you gave him earlier. speak to him again and ask him aboutrolad(optional). findroladin the east building at the entrance to the dwarven mines on the edge of theice mountain(north of falador). he says that he has already sent a delivery dwarf toport sarimwith thecatapult parts. head toport sarim, where you will findthaki the delivery dwarfin therusty anchorpub north of the docks. speak to him and try to get him to give you the metal catapult parts. however, he will refuse since you don't strike him as a sailor. search thedrunken sailoroutside to get asailor's hat. alternatively atricorn hatfrom the naval outfit will also work. wearing the hat, speak to the delivery dwarf again (who happens to notice the difference). this time you will get themetal catapult parts. since you're near the port, you could use a charter crewmember to take you to port tyras for 3,200 coins. otherwise, use the tiranwnn lodestone and find your way back to the tyras camp. bring themetal catapult partsand themahogany catapult partsto the tyras guard by the catapult north of the tyras camp and talk to him to start repairing the catapult. to repair the catapult, you will have to fit the different pieces of the catapult in a tetris-like puzzle. there are two sides: an orange and a purple side. both require certain pieces to make it work. there are many possible combinations to fill out one side, but it may not leave you with the correct pieces to complete the other. the following two pictures show the correct piece placements. controls orange side purple side completion click on a part to make it appear on the screen. use the directional arrows to move it up/down/left/right, the circular arrows to rotate it clockwise/anticlockwise, the yellow curved arrow to select the opposite side, and the green sunburst button to restart. if the wrong piece is put down, the board can be tidied up by right clicking that piece and removing it. once you have solved the puzzle, you have to test the repaired catapult. you will have to hit three stones with an 'x'. increasing the counterweight causes the stone to fly farther; decreasing the counterweight causes it to strike nearer. the direction just needs to be lined up with the arrow at the bottom of the screen. this part is fairly easy compared to the other puzzle. it requires a small amount of trial and error, but can be quickly finished. aiming the catapult controlling the catapult firing the catapult press the down arrow (to decrease weight) for closer distance or up arrow (to increase weight) for farther distance. use direction to move left or right. press the ""fire"" button to fire. after hitting all the rocks, talk to the guard again. congratulations, quest complete! catapult construction is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

and zaros. join the great and the mighty on an epic jaunt across worlds, relive one of the defining moments of gielinor's history, and prepare to find out what will happen when zaros and zamorak finally meet again. speak to yourmahjarratally,kharshai, on the tip of the frozen peninsula north ofrellekkaor (if you've completed koschei's troubles) in his cave beneath rellekka. he will explain that his divine energy, along with that of other mahjarrat, is being drained quicker than usual, requiring a new rejuvenation ritual. as he is the only one of his kind to not have picked a side in the fight betweenzarosandzamorak, he has no allies among the mahjarrat and therefore fears that he will be the one sacrificed during the upcoming ritual. he calls uponthe world guardianfor assistance. you must now make your way to themahjarrat ritual site, either by using the fairy ringdkq(glacor cave, you need to leave the cave and go slightly north-west to reach the ritual site) or by using the canoe in therellekka hunter area. if you are already prepared and ready to go there you can informkharshaithrough a dialogue option (in case you leave the dialogue after accepting the quest you must talk to him about the children of mah before the option becomes available) and he will offer to teleport you directly to the site. if you have not yet completedritual of the mahjarrat, talking with kharshai is the only way back to the ritual site. investigating theritual markerwill summon forth all mahjarrat butsliske, along with zaros who offers them immortality without having to sacrifice one another, should they choose to return tofreneskae. the zamorakian mahjarrat eagerly point out that zaros made such a promise during thesecond age, one he did not keep. they argue back and forth, untilkharshaiinterrupts the argument, saying that the only way to truly remember the events of the second age is through memory projection. he hands you acharged engrammeter, instructing you to go tothe empty throne room, beneath thevarrock dig siteand recover his memory. kharshai's memory consists of 5 fragments, each indicated by a memory spring, which must be found to unlock the full memory. the first spring is located outside of the empty throne room's entrance. the second and third are located inside the throne room at the top of each set of stairs, and the fourth and fifth springs are located on the second lowest level of the throne room on either side of the bottom level. once all five memory fragments have been collected, return to the ritual site and touch the ritual marker again. for players who have not yet completedritual of the mahjarrat, kharshai will be available at the quest starting point to teleport you back to the ritual site. the mahjarrat will reappear and you will give the stored memories to kharshai. kharshai will send you into his memories. you willassume controlof kharshai and will have to find clues and speak to characters to pass stages. you will appear in the throne room of zaros' empire. speak tojhallan,zebub,perjourandduke sucellus, inspect the red horn markings near jhallan on the pillar, and inspect the broken mouthpiece on the pillar near zebub. this will give 100% completion for the first sequence and allow you to move down the stairs. on the north side, speak withpernixandakthanakos. both will question your identity and trustworthiness. for pernix, he will ask why you are here, state that an inquisitor was sent for. then he will ask you about the markings, so you should state red horn markings. finally, he will ask about your assessment, say that there is a plot to overthrow zaros. he will then place his trust in you. for akthanakos, he will give you several questions: after correctly answering all three, akthanakos will trust you. investigate the broken enchantment (north of pernix) and the northern side will be finished. on the south side, speak with the warpriest and choose either the first or second option in the dialogue to reveal her as a demon, apprehending her. investigate the stashed weapons behind the first staircase and the red horn marking on the pillar, then speak with sliske to finish up the second level. move on down to the bottom floor and talk with azzanadra. he will ask you to judge the three in front of him as they are accused of treachery. pass judgement - kill them or not, it has little bearing on the remainder of the memory. zamorak then makes his entrance.  zamorak attempts to sway the rooms occupants to his side and you will get to choose your side - again, the choice has little bearing on the rest of the memory. after this zaros will appear and a fight will break out in cinematic cutscene, ending with zaros catching the staff in his hand when zamorak attempts to strike. when the memory ends, the mahjarrat discuss that they still do not know what happened in the last moments. zamorak will appear and offer to show them that memory with kharshai as the neutral expert. it will show that zaros thought of the mahjarrat as hired hands, and that he didn't have any intentions of helping them free themselves from their rituals. zamorak will realise the power of the staff and he strikes, siphoning zaros's energy. lowerniel drakan,hazeel,viggora,zamorak,zemouregalandthammaron. zamorak makes his demands. zaros orders his followers to retaliate. zamorak easily deflects azzanadra using the staff of armadyl. ocellus and auriculus attempt to defend their master. zamorak jumps at zaros with the staff. zaros is defeated, and zamorak ascends to godhood. the mahjarrat have decided that they must travel to freneskae to meet zaros.  kharshai has requested you to accompany him. travelto theworld gateand dial it to freneskae by selecting thesymbol or (right-click quick dial: freneskae and enter), then choose the first option when entering it (""children of mah""). talk to kharshai and zemouregal will appear, taking him captive with the intentions of sacrificing him. you will have to navigate the lava to proceed to the next area. it is a 3 lane lava river and you start in the middle lane.  jump on the rock to begin.  to avoid obstacles use the arrow keys on your keyboard or click the on-screen arrows to change lanes. be aware that while on the rock, your inventory will be disabled, and you cannot eat, drink potions, or teleport away. therefore, ensure your health is as high as possible before riding the rock. running into an obstacle will deal 2000 damage to you. damage reductions such asleviathan ringoraegis auracan reduce this damage. if you die on the lava rock, you will restart back at the beginning - this is a safe death, even forhardcore ironmen. asign of lifeand/orphoenix necklacecan be used without interrupting the puzzle. do not equipring of lifeas it will teleport you out upon activation. if you die after completing the lava rock puzzle and getting to the stone pillar lightning rod to the south, you will skip the puzzle when you re-enter. upon arriving you will face multiple level 150muspahwith 20,000 life points. it is highly recommended to useancient magicksspells for this section, as they provide vastly increased damage against the muspah, and theshard of zarosto make them non-aggressive. this is not a safe death, make sure you are prepared with proper gear, food, and potions you will find a stone pillar lightning rod to the south. muspah will appear and can be killed directly via combat; they will take 7,500 damage each time the lightning hits the rod while they are next to it. do not stand next to the lightning rod yourself or it will hurt you. you can stay next to the interactable wall east of the lightning rod, and wait for a muspah whose life has been taken down to around 5,000 points to attack.  keep killing muspah until a level 160grand force muspahappears. do not kill this muspah (disableauto-retaliate); wait for its adrenaline bar to fill up and stand next to the interactable wall. it will fire a missile; avoid the missile, and the wall will break. if you accidentally kill the grand force muspah before this happens, you will need to continue killing the lesser muspah until another grand muspah appears. run to the next area, and repeat the same process. once the second wall is broken down, you will find another lava rock. this time, there are a few muspah on the side; using protect/deflect missiles/magic is useful to shave a bit of damage; again, if you are wearing the shard of zaros, they will not attack you. as with the previous lava surfing section, your interfaces will be disabled. make your way through until you reach a lavafall; you will fall down, but seren will save you in time. continue the dialogue with seren, then enter the cave nearby to reach mah's ritual marker.  the remaining mahjarrat will appear, in addition to zemouregal, who attempts to sacrifice kharshai. fortunately for kharshai, he fails, as zaros appears and intervenes. continue through the dialogue until zamorak appears. zamorak and zaros will battle, with zamorak being easily overpowered by the difference in strength, his wings disintegrating in the process. he stops attacking and begins sacrificing his energy, channelling it into the other mahjarrat. zaros, noticing this, halts his attack, refusing to make zamorak a martyr. they discuss and agree to theviniculum juris, a demonic pact that binds the participants to uphold their end or be 'undone' (destroyed). they begin the ritual, disturbing mah in her sleep - zaros will ask you to go and stop her. walk on the north up to the top of the mountain. you will find seren, who will send you into mah's dreams. zaros defeats zamorak, destroying his wings. zamorak uses some of his power to empower the mahjarrat. zaros and zamorak make a pact. you have a progress bar above your head for the entirety of mah's dream section. the bar fills when you are in the dark, and slowly drains when you are inside of the light. should the bar completely fill, you become disturbed by thenightmares- while in the dark, you now take 250 damage every 2 ticks. if you die here from taking damage, this is not a safe death and you will be transported to death's office. you can heal before each dream. the progress bar is reset after each stage. should you fail any stage, you will reappear by seren and be allowed to return to the start of the stage you failed. if you leave freneskae, you can return to the world gate to re-enter, then speak to seren to continue. in addition to easier modes, you can also wearagile armour,wicked robe outfitandboots of lightnessto do it faster, especially dream 3. as soon as you enter the first area, you will find the core of mah in the centre surrounded by 8 darkened light shard pillars. there will also be four bladed muspahs, each at the 4 walls; they cannot be attacked. click on the core of mah to begin a dialogue with seren. seren will give you aglowing orband tells you to protect the core. the muspah send shadows out which will deal 1000 damage to the core if they touch it - the core has 6,000 life. the shadows are dispelled by clicking on the light shard the shadow is coming through to insert the orb. seren's light will drive back the dark of these nightmares. another muspah will send out another shadow; click on the lit light shard to remove the orb and click on the other light shard to dispel the new shadow. protect the core until the meter reaches 0% to proceed to the next area. when you start after speaking to seren, the room darkens; click on any shard to lighten the room and click again to remove the orb to place it in the nearest shard to dispel the shadow. in this next area, there are unattackablenightmares. make your way east to find a stone shard blocking the way.  go further east touching the light pillar when you reach it; you take a orb and the path will be completely dark. go back west to find the block open. run towards the newly opened area and interact with zemouregal or azzanadra to escape. the second set now has six mahjarrat, 3 in the north and 3 in the south. seren gives you two glowing orbs. repeat the process as before; should you fail three times a new 'easy mode' option will become available. leaving will reset the number of attempts to 0. after this set, you will be sent into another dark area with more unattackable nightmares.  a stone shard to the south blocks the way; trying to open it gives a message to use the red light shard. the light shard (red) is in the middle of the room, touching it gives a message 'the pillar doesn't respond, as if it isn't ready yet.'  go to the open path to the west, touch the light shard there, then go across to the other path east and touch that light shard. go back to the centre room and touch the red light shard to remove the stone shard and go south.  exit via zaros or seren. the final, third set has 4 serens at each corner and 4 zaros at each wall as mah's final nightmares. you will get three orbs this time. repeat the same process. as with dream 2, if you fail too many times the 'easy mode' option will appear with the same restrictions on leaving. if you still fail on easy mode, another option will appear 'with seren's help'. it is helpful to leave two of the lights in place and only focus on moving one. when finished, seren will pull you out of mah's dreams. zaros's ritual has completed and drained almost all of mah's energy from her - her mind is corrupted and broken, but her body remains living in agony. seren, seeing this, will mercifully kill mah. finish up her dialogue and return to the marker. zamorak and the mahjarrat will recognise that seren's energy signature is the same as mah's, subsequently realising that seren posed as mah when they were taught the rituals of enervation and rejuvenation originally. seren argues that she did so to prevent mah from ripping freneskae apart, as she believed that the rituals helped to curtail her wrath and maintain the planet'sanima mundi. they are angered that seren had sent their race towards extinction doing this, although zaros supports seren. conversely, seren is angered that zaros killed mah through the ritual. the mahjarrat taunt her, infuriating her until zaros convinces her to leave the planet. the mahjarrat decide that, while they still have grudges with each other, they should work together now that they don't have to complete any more rituals. zaros will teleport up to mah's corpse, asking you to meet him there. you can now speak to each of the mahjarrat about their plans and other topics - head back up to mah and speak to zaros to continue. zaros will tell you that, while he loathed mah, he has a sense of sadness with her death, and can understand seren's anger at having to kill their mother. however, he is pleased that there is something dormant inside her and that it will further his future plans. he will then give you a reward for helping save the mahjarrat. congratulations, quest complete! in the first two weeks after the release, players were rewarded an additional chapter inkharshai's journalas anearly bird bonus. after the quest, you can return to the lava falls via theworld gateto replay the lava surfing minigame and to investigate the fourmahjarrat deathstonesif you didn't do so during the quest. investigating all four deathstones is amaster quest caperequirement. children of mah is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: concept art of children of mah concept art used for the head banner, depicting the younger zamorak and zaros the quest was announced atrunefest 2015. its original premise was thatmah, furious after the events offate of the gods, would destroy the universe and begin it anew, starting with freneskae. the mahjarrat would react to its destruction: by returning to their homeworld for one last goodbye, attempting to confront mah or to regain something they left behind. like the finished version, it would also have featured a showdown between zaros and zamorak.[1]"

different letter from a to l: they may say they ate these food: what the children call ""green gloop soup"", the merchants call the soup ""cave slime soup"". the two poisoned foods should be the

will be upset but will still let you entersigmund's baseafter you say the password. do not talk tosigmundhere, as he will recognise you and will have you thrown out. it's easy to recognise him as he is the only h.a.m member who runs instead of walks, and he also wears h.a.m robes that are a slightly darker purple than the other fanatics. in the base, the players cannot teleport outside. attempting to do so will generate the message, 'the glyphs on the wall prevent you from teleporting'. go to the room near the jail cell in the south eastern corner of the base. talk to theguarduntil he says what the current day is. now read the noticeboard on the nearby south wall and match the current day with a name. pickpocket theh.a.m. agentfrom the main room whose name matches the one on the noticeboard, and then give the letter to the guard outside the jail cell. enter the next room, pick theh.a.m. prison keyup from the floor, use the key on the cell door, and talk togrubfoot. tell grubfoot to wait while you distract the guard. first you have to unlock the doors in the room opposite the room with the jail in it. to unlock both doors, go through the kitchen in the south west part of the room, and squeeze through the hole on the east wall. then, unlock both doors just by opening each of them. now grubfoot can go to the room west of the jail. when you have both doors opened go back to grubfoot and tell him ""let's go"", and ""i'll distract the guard, then you make a break for it"". walk out the door and talk to the guard while standing to the north of him. grubfoot will walk out one door and in through another. if you haven't unlocked the doors, the guard will notice grubfoot and throw you out of the hideout. once grubfoot has successfully snuck into the next room, tell him to wait at the west door (do not tell him to go through the crack or the east door as you will be caught) while you distract the next guard. he will take his position at the door. crawl through the hole in the wall into the kitchen. you will bump the sink full of dirty dishes and the guard will come into the kitchen to investigate the noise. he will ask what you are up to; you can select either response. grubfoot will sneak into the bedroom. go into the room where grubfoot is now hiding and tell him to follow you. go out the side door on the north-east side where the guard is not located and through the small maze of crates. you will get ""caught"" by a guard, but grubfoot will hit him with a spell, stunning him long enough for you and grubfoot to escape. walk up the ramp and out the door at the top. as you walk out of the door, you will see zanik and an army of goblins attacking the h.a.m. members.sigmundwill attack you, and zanik will come to your aid. when he is near death, he will try to escape using his ring of life, but zanik will cut off his left hand, preventing him from escaping. if sigmund's protection prayers prevent you from doing any damage to him, you may need to switch combat styles. for example, if he usesprotect from ranged, switch to magic. once he activatesprotect from magic, switch back to range and so on until he is defeated. this can be done with any two combat styles. he should then try to use the ring of life. you will be given the choice to either agree, disagree, or give no comments about killing sigmund. but in the conversation, zanik says she never had the choice when she was captured by the h.a.m. group and kills him despite your reaction. using a damage over time ability orrevolutioncombat mode may cause sigmund to continue attacking, in which case you will have to leave and reenter the base. speak to zanik, and she will quickly tell you that you will be killed next. she will begin to attack you. during this fight, using poison against zanik will interrupt crucial dialogue that you have with her. for this reason, players may want to avoid using poison weapons, or any form of damage that can stop zanik from having a conversation with the player. when you finally get her health down to 0 she will comment on how she can't die and her health will be replenished. you must continue to attack her. each time her health gets down to 0, select the positive responses that encourage her to fight the mind-controlling powers she is under, and reminds her of your friendship. you can use the number of goblins and ham agents left standing in the battle below as a gauge on how close you are. when only one goblin remains, you are finished. after you kill her four or more times you will be able to select the option telling her to take off the pendant she is wearing. she will take the pendant off and fling it down below, where the goblinhigh priestwill pick it up and cause an earthquake. zanik will take your hand and teleport the both of you out of the collapsing hideaway. zanik leads the invasion of goblins. zanik cuts sigmund's hand off. having to fight zanik... bandos takes over the goblin high priest. teleporting away with zanik you will appear in a small cave. zanik will give you anoil lampif you do not have a light source and tells you that the teleportation must have been a bit off since there were two people travelling. walk through the cave until there is an earthquake, and zanik gets stuck on the other side of a rock wall. call her through the fallen rocks if she is alright, and then clean the fallen rocks. walk through the path, and you will see zanik on a small ledge. tell her that she has to try to get out using her crossbow as a grapple. she will shoot it once. direct her fire accordingly so that she hits a small rock that is jutting out of the rock wall. after saving zanik, head out of the cave, and go north to talk tojuna. she will explain about zanik's destiny. go north and then west until you reach a tunnel. enter the tunnel. go north to dorgesh-kaan by first jumping over the stepping stones. zanik will also tell you to head north to avoid thewall beasts. do not teleport or leave from the lumbridge cellar or you will have to go back for zanik. if you fall in the water when jumping across the stepping stone in thelumbridge swamp cavesand did not bring a covered light source, your source will go out and you will be left in the dark if you do not relight it. talk tokazgar, and travel to thedorgesh-kaan mine. now head to the middle of the city and talk tocaptain undak, who will tell you that a glowing suit of armour has come through a portal into the city and tell you to return to the council chamber. go north and up the stairs to meet once again with the council. a cutscene ensues where you learn that bandos has issued an ultimatum to the dorgesh-kaan: serve him or be destroyed. after some debate between zanik and the council, the council agrees to fight. after the cutscene, go back to the council chamber and talk to thegoblin scribe. agree to help put together atime capsule. go to the centre of town, where theobeliskis, and head east through a corridor, then north to findtegdak. talk to him to get abox of artefacts. go back and talk to the scribe. he will seal the time capsule for you and tell you to talk tomistag. find mistag in the dorgesh-kaan mine near the city entrance, located northeast from the stairs leading to the council chamber, and ask him to bury the time capsule. go back todorgesh-kaan, and findoldakin a room in the north-west corner. he tells you he needs parts from the power station south of the city. make sure you have a light source again then go all the way to the south of the city, go up the stairs into theagility course, head east to the power station, go down the stairs, and talk toturgall. ask him forenergy projectorsand afocusing chamber. oldak is now at the portal. head to the southern end of the marketplace, to the room on the east where you arrested the poison supplier andzanikappeared from the portal. talk to oldak. he will take the parts and give youzanik's crossbow. give the crossbow back to zanik. she tells you to go check on the children at the nursery. go back north, and go up the first set of stairs on the eastern side. the nursery will be on the south-east. talk tomernikwhen you get there. she will ask you to talk withambassador alvijarin the house north of the nursery. talk to him about sending the dorgeshuun children tokeldagrimas refugees. he refuses, as taking refugees could endanger keldagrim. return to mernik and speak with her. go to the bank and prepare for battle, if you haven't already. return tozanikby the portal. agree to start fighting, and you will be teleported to the throne room. before you begin to fight the avatar, it is suggested to put your combat inlegacy mode. this will prevent you from using any damage-over-time abilities that might unintentionally regenerate the avatar. once inside the throne room with zanik, kill thebandos avatar, who uses melee. as it will not move, an effective way to kill the avatar is with magic or ranged; magic is recommended as it is weak to fire spells. likewise, thegoblin statuesit summons are weak to water spells. you can then stand a distance from the avatar and let zanik take most of the damage. protection prayers may not be necessary, but pay attention if you stand near any statues, in which case they will be able to deal damage. when the avatar dies, command zanik to use the special. bandos will hit her crossbow, breaking it into three pieces, and summon anogre statue. attempt to pick up the pieces of the crossbow. you cannot usetelekinetic grabto pick up the pieces. for every piece you try to pick up, you will have to defeat a statue which he will summon. usezanik's crossbowwith either theenergy projectoror thefocusing chamberto reassemble zanik's special crossbow. the avatar will then ""kill"" zanik. defeat the avatar again. once you have defeated him and a chat box comes up, do not interrupt it or do anything else, or he will regenerate and you will have to fight him again. if you are in the middle of a special ability when he is defeated, it will automatically interrupt the chat when it completes, and you will have to fight the avatar again. to prevent this, once the avatar nears death, use only special attacks that are instantaneous in effect, not those that work over a period of time. talk to the avatar, and choose to use zanik's crossbow's special attack on him (you cannot wield the crossbow; the special attack is a dialogue option). he will die. if you are still being attacked by a statue when you kill the avatar for the last time, the conversation will be interrupted and the avatar will regenerate, although you can trap the statue behind the avatar. one way to prevent this is to kill the statue a few steps from the avatar and turn on protect from magic so the avatar cannot affect you. pick up the pendant dropped by the avatar, then talk to zanik, then sit down next to her, then say nothing. she will revive, and destroy the pendant. after you step through the portal, a rather long cut-scene will follow, summing up all the previous quests in the series. congratulations! quest complete! zanik smashes the pendant. the gathering of the citizens.  the chosen commander is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: bandos avatar in detail the banner shown onrunescapehomepage when the quest was

this quest, the world guardian ventures into the lost capital of the zarosian empire,senntisten. but be wary, adventurer - city of senntisten represents your last chance to bolster your defences and weaken the elder gods before they launch a full assault on gielinor, and danger lurks in every shadow. will you be able to unite the gods of gielinor and transform the city into the fortress it needs to be? speak toarianeoutside of theheart of gielinor. she will be relieved to see that you are well following thebattle of the monolith. due tozaros' tampering with the codex, the eggs have now begun to hatch and they must be stopped lestthe great revisionprematurely starts. ariane will tell you that she foundreldoto help with research and brings you inside theelder halls. once inside, talk to either ariane or charos again. charos will be amazed by the amount ofanimain the elder halls, but they need to find a way to move the eggs out of the halls and drain them of theshadow animato stall them from hatching. however, you have no idea on how to do so, beforeazzanadrateleports in. having no orders for the first time in thousands of years, he still believes zaros is doing the right thing but wishes to atone for hisearlier deception. with his new power, he can assist in moving the eggs. azzanadra explains that theelder godsmust physically touch their eggs to make them hatch and if they cannot reach them, will send forces to claim the eggs. he does not know who they will send apart from thetokhaar, but warns that they will be very powerful. the eggs must be kept safe from their forces at all costs, and the battle must be away from the common people. azzanadra will then suggest the recent discovery ofsenntistento hide the eggs, as it is remote and easy to defend. he will teleport away, asking you to meet him inguildmaster tony's office in thearchaeology guild. azzanadra will be disguised as dr nabanik on the balcony ofarchaeology guild's1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]. azzanadra will be conflicted with his duties, as while you have helped him many times in the past, it is the first time he has betrayed your trust, and he wishes to regain it. while he can move the eggs, he will also need the help of the other gods in draining the shadow anima; he will ask you to find and convincearmadyl,saradomin,seren,zamorak, andicthlarin, knowing that they will try to protectgielinor, and, in the case of saradomin and zamorak, empower themselves. armadyl can be found atophis towerbetweenport sarimand theclan camp. he will agree to help without knowing of the full plan, as he can see the situation is bad enough based on your expressions. because of seren's growing influence on the council, he had decided to take a short reprieve and returned toabbinah. icthlarin, seren, and zamorak (viamoia) can all be reached throughcouncil of burthorpe. icthlarin will not work with themahjarratdue to the previous grievances bysliske, but he will help find another solution. seren is also reluctant to help, but chooses to nonetheless as she must clean up her brother's mistakes. for zamorak, speak to moia to have her teleport you to his hideout; using thecommunication devicewill not work. zamorak has anticipated your arrival. while he could have intervened at themysterious monolith, he explains that he had to return toinfernusto quell an uprising of zarosian loyalists, believing them to be a part ofzaros' plan to keep him away from gielinor. he will gladly assist, as he does not want to miss out on free power and wonders what has become of azzanadra, having heard of his ascension before having you leave. if you ask him to do so for you, he will teleport you to the northern area ofdaemonheim. saradomin will be in thewhite knights' castleas usual. while he is skeptical of azzanadra's involvement, he believes that his eyes have been opened now that zaros has abandoned him. he will ask you where the defence will be staged, and learn from you that it will be at senntisten. while he is skeptical at first due to being there in its destruction, you tell him that an intact section has been discovered. he will then head there and offer aid if he is convinced of its defences. with everyone accounted for, return to azzanadra at the archaeology guild. azzanadra will be upset that icthlarin is not willing to help, but you explain to him that he is looking for other solutions, which he will accept as a substitute. head north-west to the entrance of senntisten (south-west from the mansion frombroken home, and east oftolna's rift) and enter theancient door. azzanadra will have you excavate what is left to enter the city. excavate theforum entrance, which clears upon excavating 25 materials. speak to azzanadra, who informs you that apontifex maximus figurineis needed to enter this area of the city. inspect theempty pedestalto find adamaged oneand restore it. if you need materials, you can talk to azzanadra and then tointern jimmyfor the materials, but you will need to supply thedragonstone. then return and place it in. thebarrierwill then dissipate; follow azzanadra, who will walk over to thecathedral. if you lose or destroy the pontifex maximus figurine, you will need to excavate and restore another one fromkharid-et chapel debrisat thekharid-et dig site. talk to azzanadra, who is willing to tell you some of the section's history. this was one of the few areas where zarosian loyalists held out until the city was buried. he also mentions there is an avernic arsenal, a blood bank, and theinquisitionheadquarters as some of the more notable areas. allow azzanadra to teleport the eggs in. with no way back now that the eggs have been teleported, azzanadra states that there are four magical wards to be set up that will help protect the eggs further. he explains that he suspects that theancient magickshave come from somewhere else, and as such, believes that it will serve as an extra barrier against the elder gods in place of a barrier of shadow anima. he will tell you to look for the first one, which is inside the cathedral. search thebookcases,chests,crates, andpewsin the cathedral to find onelight globe. inform azzanadra that you cannot find anything outside of the globes, and he will remember there was a building outside in the western part of the city that contained a spare. azzanadra will warn you that the shadows of the capital are real, and advises you bring some food before you try looking for the wards. if you have not done so, get some combat gear and a large amount of high-healing food. all of the wards will be found in the western part of the city. while in the shadows (not nearby alit light pedestalor inside a building), ashadows of the empiredebuff will be occasionally applied. this debuff deals damage periodically that further intensifies as more stacks are accumulated. the debuff stack will decrease when you are within a lit light pedestal or inside a building. the light pedestals may be lit by placing alight globeon them. deaths here are considered safe, overriding active signs; azzanadra will get you back into the cathedral, but any wards you have will be lost and need to be reclaimed again. if you are carrying a ward when you near the pedestals where the light globes can be placed, the ward will extinguish the light, so keep moving. open buildings are already illuminated and will not be extinguished no matter what so can be used to clear stacks even when carrying wards. there are several light globes in some of the western wing's buildings, enough to cover almost all of the pedestals, but it is not necessary to obtain them all to complete the quest. it is highly recommended to bring lots of food, an item with themobileperk and dual-wielded melee weapons to usebladed diveif not havingdiveunlocked.powerbursts of accelerationcan also be helpful, notably for returning to the cathedral with theshadow ward. the shadow damage can also be reduced by the passive effect ofsaradominorzamorakwarpriest armour,leviathan ring, or by theluckyperk, though this should not be relied upon due to the low activation chance of these effects. the debuff will not cause damage or continue to stack while the interface for the various notes is open. however, your life points will continue to replenish as normal. teleporting outside of the city will cause the wards to disappear from your backpack. the wards can be delivered to azzanadra in any order, but only one can be carried at a time. wards are delivered to azzanadra by talking to him with one in backpack. theblood wardis kept in the blood bank which can be found in the second northernmost building in the southern section of the western wing. there will be a closed off section with ablood bottlenearby; inspect it. this will allow theold deskandpile of bookson the counter to be searchable. upstairs you will find an additional light globe. search the pile of books by the entrance desk for ahandwritten note, and the old desk for thechecklist. now leave the building, and travel north. head to the northern section of the western part of the city and enter the house with thebloodied noteinside. search theransacked deskto find ablood bank ledgerand read it; you will realise that someone was taking more blood than usual. the puzzle requires to add the correct amounts of blood to the blood bottle to unlock the door to the blood ward. the solution is found by first noting the day 478 stock take from the ledger: next, apply the steps in thechecklistto obtain the following quantities: then, subtract the withdrawals for day 479 found in the ledger to obtain the following quantities: then, add the deposits for day 479 found in the ledger to obtain the following quantities: comparing these values to the stock take for day 479 in the ledger, you will find the missing blood to be 2/8 bottles of aviansie and human blood, 1/8 bottles of dragon blood, and 3/8 bottles of unicorn blood. the bottles of blood that need to be added can be found by searching theshelves. from these bottles the blood is added to the blood bottle by the door by using each item on the bottle and specifying the number of eighths to pour in. so use the bottles ofaviansie bloodandhuman bloodand for each enter '2' into the input box, for thedragon bloodenter '1', and for theunicorn bloodenter '3' to unlock the door. the bottles of blood can be used in any order. the lock will then activate and release a level 114blood wardenwho has 50,000life points. despite being a vyre, he can be harmed with any weapon. he has no weakness, and attacks using only melee with minor magic damage. the blood warden will heal when his life points gets low up to two times, so be prepared to outdamage his healing or to endure the equivalent of an up to 150,000 life pointboss. in addition, he will heal from any damage-over-time abilities that hit him, so avoid using them; this can be aided by either temporarily removing them from yourrevolutionrotation or simply using full manual. legacy mode is not recommended unless you have a strong special attack weapon to finish him off as you may not be able to outpace his healing otherwise.deathtouched dartswork on him. when the blood warden is dead, you can remove the blood ward from thepedestal. to leave the room, activate the blood bottle. deliver the ward to azzanadra in the cathedral. theice wardcan be found on thepedestalsouth-west from the westerncathedral door, after the second set of steps. deliver the ward to azzanadra in the cathedral. theshadow wardis found in the inquisitor's headquarters that is located in the far north of the northern section of the western part of the city. head inside and try to take the ward from thepedestal. you will find that there is a magical barrier stopping you from taking it. go upstairs and take theinquisition profiles, a book written bysliske, sitting on thedesk. read the book to find the four names that are the key to dispelling the barrier. make sure to complete the dialogue after reading the book or the quest will not progress. if needed, there is alight globeavailable in this room, and another next to the shadow ward downstairs. there aredrawersin the room corresponding to each letter of the alphabet. before you start the puzzle, make sure that all of the drawers are closed by pressing thesuspicious dial. the puzzle requires you to have the correct drawers open. this can be achieved by spelling the names titus, dagroda, castyx, and gready found in the inquisition profiles by opening or closing the drawers corresponding to each letter in these names. the drawers should look like this when done, with the red squares representing the open ones: once this configuration is met, you will feel that the magic surrounding the ward is dispelled. go downstairs and take the shadow ward from the pedestal. if you made a mistake, then press the suspicious dial again to reset the puzzle and make sure that the drawers are configured as described above. if you allow the damage to stack while delivering the ward to the cathedral, there is a high probability that the shadows of the empire debuff will do enough damage to kill you in a single hit before you reach the cathedral. you can stop inside the building halfway to the cathedral with the light globes on theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us](marked with a yellow square on the map) to clear the stack. alternatively, you can use apowerburst of accelerationto quickly get back to the cathedral without needing to stop. thesmoke wardcan be found on thepedestalin the avernic arsenal south-west from the cathedral annex where the ice ward was located. upon getting close, fourgargoyle sentinelswill animate and fly off, with one of them summoning a barrier to protect the ward. the player fails to identify which of the gargoyle sentinels placed the barrier and needs to kill all four to break it. each gargoyle sentinel is level 127 with 25,000life points, and is weak to water spells. it is recommended to place alight globeon alight pedestalnear the gargoyle you are about to fight, and if they are out of the safety of the light, to lure them towards a lit light pedestal. alternatively, hit the gargoyle sentinel and run inside a building so you do not sustain extra damage from the shadows of the empire debuff. as gargoyles, you will need aslayerlevel of 75 and arock hammerin your backpack ortool beltto finish them off. first attack on the gargoyle will use the rock hammer to smash the statue. right click on gargoyle and choose attack to activate fighting with the style of your choice. when the gargoyle is down to one health, right click gargoyle again and choose smash option to defeat (activating the rock hammer again). alternatively, if the killing blows ability for gargoyles has been purchased withslayer points, the finishing rock hammer smash will be automatically activated.deathtouched dartsdon't work on the gargoyle sentinels. the gargoyle sentinels can be found in the following locations: once all four gargoyle sentinels have been killed, the smoke ward can be taken from the pedestal and delivered to azzanadra. after givingazzanadrathe first ward,serenwill teleport in, upset with azzanadra's actions as it will rile theelder gods. azzanadra states that he is following orders. nonetheless, seren will protect the eggs, informing azzanadra thathelwyrand his cadre of elite warriors are on the way to the city. azzanadra will also forgive seren for her actions, as while it may have endangered themahjarrat, he has come to the realization that it has strengthened them, and that the mahjarrat would have been extinct long ago if she had not done so. after giving azzanadra the second ward,saradominwill teleport in. while he does not agree with the zarosians, he knows thatzaroshas abandoned his followers and that azzanadra is not as zealous as he once was, despite the mahjarrat's insistence otherwise. saradomin knows that his people cannot defend themselves from cosmic threats, and such falls to him to do so, while his people defend their own lands. saradomin also insists that azzanadra make the most of thetemple knightshe took from him, and thatcommander zilyanawill be coming to assist. after giving azzanadra the third ward,zamorakwill teleport in. he will sarcastically state that he is glad to now have a new competitor and tells him when he ascended, he felt zaros' loyalty aura fading. he has also called for bothk'ril tsutsarothand thetwin furiesto assist in the defence. azzanadra insists that he remains loyal to zaros, but zamorak tells him to mull over it and that he should think for himself. zamorak and saradomin will be upset with each others' presence, but azzanadra tells them not to ignite their rivalries, lest they deal with three malformed elder hatchlings and four vengeful parents. knowing that the entire universe is at stake and not wanting to bring calamity upon their followers, both gods reluctantly agree. with the final ward given,armadylwill arrive. he does not wish to lead his people to another war and has sent them back to their homeworld, much to azzanadra's consternation as not even theabysswill be safe inthe great revision. armadyl states that he wants his people to live in peace regardless of what happens and that there is more to being a god than being a tactician, butkree'arrawill be joining them due to his insistence on taking action. with all the preparations done,kerapacwill appear as a projection. he states that while he would have gladly assisted in the plan, the world guardian's intervention duringdesperate measureshas taken his freedom of choice and turned him into a servant of jas. the elder gods are not pleased with the actions taken by the world guardian and the gods, and are preparing their forces for an assault on the cathedral to reclaim the eggs by force. kerapac finds it ironic that his role has been switched with the role of the world guardian during their last encounter, and informs the gathered party that he is coming with his army before disappearing. the gods realise that, as suspected, the elder gods are sending their forces instead of personally intervening. since the gods need someone to coordinate their own unified defence, seren suggestsazzanadrashould do so. he begrudgingly agrees, reassuring you that he and the others will do their best to hold the elder gods' forces off for as long as they can, expressing faith that you can find a solution before all is lost. as a reward for your efforts, he will teach you four newancient magicksspells. congratulations, quest complete! city of senntisten is

children being our greatest treasure, but children are ambitious. mah’s children, more than most. and all threads in that tapestry eventually lead back to him. to zaros. his ambitions are the greatest, to become an elder god himself. he sees it as his birthright, but sometimes a good parent must just say no. now, i’m not sure i’ve ever seen a child who accepted that. most children will sneak behind their parents back, sticking to the shadows. fun at the time, but a nightmare if you’re caught. because playing with shadows will always come back to haunt you. but imagine if you will, creeping through those layers of senntisten. layers of a delicious historical sandwich. unearthing the bounty from each age of occupation. imagine the secrets that lie within, and the terrors that were left there to rot. and with no risk, there’s no reward. worth a shot, heroes? i expect so. relative to the timeline presented bymod osborneat runefest 2019, 'city of senntisten' was the final

when you do so,postie petewill appear saying that he has delivered a package to your house and has stuck a note in the portal. choose the ""a clockwork syringe"" option from your portal to retrieve the note.again, the quest will not progress if you right-click ""enter house""; you need to select the dialogue option from the menu.
read thedelivery noteto open the quest interface to officially begin the quest. accept the quest, and you will begin reading thescroll; a receipt declaring that ""1x large and totally inconspicuous crate"" was delivered to your player-owned house. once more, click the portal and select the ""a clockwork syringe"" option to progress in the quest. a warning appears, foreshadowing the coming events. note: do not investigate the package unless you are prepared for immediate combat. this is a safe fight, meaning you will not lose any items. if you leave the fight before destroying the enemy, you will need to re-enter your house the same way as described in the previous section. the player is recommended to disable theevolution of combatrevolutionmode, as many of the special moves are unavailable within the player-owned house environment. the crate contains a level 98barrelchest mk iiwhich uses melee and ranged attacks, and drains the player'sconstitutionlevel. because of this,super restore potionsand otherstat-boosting itemsare recommended to use during the fight. the barrelchest mk ii is tougher than its level suggests, featuring 30,000lpand a special attack. if usingprotectionordeflect prayers, it will only use the opposite attack style from the one being protected from. every so often, the barrelchest will use a special attack, preluded by a blue glow and it shouting, ""prepare yerself!"". the attack has a range of approximately 10 squares, knocking you backwards and destroying the furnishings of your house (food sources, exit portals, altars, etc.). the attack does no direct damage to you, but does further reduce your constitution level, so it is especially advised to keep an eye on your health. anything destroyed during the fight will be repaired immediately after the fight, so players do not need to worry about any sort of loss. as your constitution is drained, the maximum number of life points to which you can heal is decreased. super restore potions may be used to replenish the drained levels, and it is recommended that you recover your maximum constitution level before facing additionalcombatlater in the quest. if the player has achapelbuilt next to an open area (such as agardenormenagerie), another strategy that may be used is to wait for the barrelchest to destroy the open area, then retreat into the chapel. you will be able to range through the window spaces safely, and the barrelchest will not be able to move nor attack you if you use protect from/deflect missiles (he will attempt to attack you using melee if you use this prayer, but will be unable to due to the walls). however, note that any ammo used will be lost at the end of the fight if it is not picked up before the barrelchest's health reaches 0 (a cutscene begins immediately after his defeat). furthermore, there is always a chance that the barrelchest may enter the chapel (or any other room in your house, for that matter). once the barrelchest has been defeated, anestate agentwill appear and inform you of the repairs that have been done to your house. he remarks that the repairs were covered by insurance as ""acts of zombio-mechanical piracy"", although he did not think such a thing would actually happen (the special coverage was only added to the insurance policy to make the list of covered circumstances seem more attractive). the agent will (conveniently) take the delivery note as proof and leave you to deal with the severed head. after the estate agent has left, speak to thezombie head; all that remains of the original barrelchest. the head will refuse to divulge any information, so you must ""persuade"" it until its stress level reaches a certain threshold. use all five options when they are available, and the zombie's stress level will soon reach its maximum. the head will explain that he was sent byrabid jackto destroy you and that an army of even more barrelchests are currently being built to launch wave of destruction onmos le'harmless. when the zombie head refuses to reveal any more information, you stuff it in your bag and take it with you to informbill teachof the news. note:the head may be found in your house if lost. travel toport phasmatysand speak tobill teachaboardhis ship. port phasmatys may be quickly reached using theectophial, or by using thefairy ringcodealq. alternatively, the player maychartera ship to the port phasmatys docks. bill will tell you that something this important must be spoken of only in utmost privacy. he will direct you toharpoon joe's house of 'rum'inmos le'harmless. take bill's ship from the dock in port phasmatys to mos le'harmless and head toharpoon joe'spub, just north west from the bank. if you've marked the quest asactive, both pubs on the island will be highlighted on yourworld map/minimap; you need to visit the northern of the two pubs. sit in the chair in the corner of the room and ask joe for ""a long drop"". when he asks if you're sure, tell him ""aye, drop me."", and you'll drop into the secret meeting room in the basement. bill teach will be waiting for you in the basement of the pub. talk to him and explain what happened in yourplayer-owned house. when he asks for evidence, place the zombie head on the table. after a short discussion, he will tell you that he knows of a way to make the zombie talk, but he'll need some special equipment. he'll hand you a very convenientteleport scrolland ask you to retrieve a ""twiblick night special"" fromcaptain braindeathonbraindeath island. if you haven't prepared for the coming sections, exit the basement of the pub and use the nearby bank to prepare for combat. once geared-up, use the teleport scroll's option to travel to braindeath island. (the scroll requires that there be space to the north of you in order to cast the spell, aspirate petewill appear and knock you out, in usual fashion, before your journey. note:you will not be allowed to summon familiars or equip items to your helmet and cape slots for the next portion of the quest. after arriving on braindeath island, speak tocaptain braindeathand ask him for the twiblick night special. he will ruefully inform you that several of hisbrewershave recently gone missing. offer to find out what became of them, and he will suggest you look near the dungeon entrance near thevolcanoto the north. as the dungeon is submerged, you will need adiving apparatusandfishbowl helmetto proceed. if you don't have yours with you, captain braindeath will give you his, and take yours from your bank. note:if you die while in this dungeon, your grave will appear outside the entrance. with your diving gear and combat equipment, exit the door on the south end of the building, descend the stairs, head west, and then north, past50% lukeand across the bridges toward the volcano until you reach what appears to be the entrance to aresource dungeon. combat begins immediately upon entering the dungeon. the monsters inside attack usingmeleeandranged, and generally hit harder and more accurately than other monsters of similar levels. it may be advised to useprotect from missilesin addition to a high meleedefence bonusorprotect from meleewith a highranged defence bonus. note:that if you've completedas a first resort, you can use thethermal bathto give you temporary immunity to poison such that you won't need to carry anyantipoisonif you move fast. either way, you should be prepared to deal with the poison of the malpractitioners, as it hits hard in a location where regular attacks are already highly accurate. the dungeon is laid out similarly to a typicaldungeoneeringfloor, and is composed of three wings (west, north, and east). venture down each wing, each culminating in a room with a door lockable from the inside. it is advisable to close the door to prevent additional monsters from venturing inside, as interference by mobs makes it difficult to search the brewers. kill anygeneral malpractitionersin the room to avoid interference with your investigation. once the general malpractitioners have been dealt with, the'rum'-pumped crabscan usually be trapped behind obstacles. if you are unable to trap the crabs, quickly dispose of them (stabbing weapons are quite effective). investigate each brewer's body to discover their names. the general malpractitioners attack using apoisonousranged attack, and the 'rum'-pumped crabs use an accurate melee attack. the crabs may be trapped behind various pillars, while the level 84 general malpractitioners attack you using range from a distance, hurling exploding syringes at you. interestingly, the general malpractitioners also hurl syringes at the crabs, saying, ""taste some 'rum', little crab!"" as they throw, to which the crabs reply, ""click-click-rawr!"". the crab they target receives anaccuracyboost as well as an increase inattack speed, therefore, it is again recommended that your primary goal be to kill the general malpractitioners when clearing the rooms. optional:even if you are high enough level to ignore the enemies you should kill a crab in order to complete the hard daemonheim achievementalcrabholicwhile you're here. once you have discovered the name of the last worker, head back to captain braindeath with the news. before the captain hands over the twiblick night special, he will force you to take a rigorous oath. after taking the oath, he will hand over the special, telling you that bill teach has the key to open it. with the special in hand, use the teleport scroll to be transported back to mos le'harmless, and take the long drop once again, back into the basement in joe's pub. speak with bill and he'll unlock the twiblick night special, which he will then have you open. after more suspenseful warnings and numerous drawn-out phrases, the player is presented with the contents of the twiblick night special: feminine wigs and various kinds of make-up.remember: what happens at sea stays at sea!speak once more with bill, and he'll tell you that the plan is to give the zombie a ""makeover"", and then parade him around in front of his old crew. choose what to beautify the zombie head with, and the zombie head will quickly spill the beans and tell you that the barrelchests are being manufactured onbloodsplatter isle(in typical, piratey fashion). note:it is suggested to bring food or healing potions for the next trip, as there are times when you may be attacked while on the bloodsplatter isle. return south to bill's ship, the 'adventurous', talk to him, and use the ""a clockwork syringe"" option to begin your travel. speak to bill again once underway, and after some short dialogue bill's ship,the adventurouswill begin taking fire from the island. you are forced to find an alternative way to the island yourself: building acannonball barrel-boatto launch yourself there. bill will tell you to go to the lower parts of the ship, where there are parts to make the barrel boat. descend the bridge of the ship using the stairs, walk north to the bow, and climb down the ladder under next to the mast. once there, rifle through the gun locker to find a cannonball, search the repair locker for a chain, take a barrel from the barrel stack, and pick up at least three (3) fist-fulls ofgunpowderfrom the powder barrel. next, use the gunpowder on the chain to flash-heat it. then smith the heated chain and cannonball on the anvil. lastly, use yourcannonball and chainon the barrel. the cannonball barrel-boat is now ready. go back up the ladder to the main deck. you'll depart from the starboard-side cannon (right side of the ship), which will require ""two (2) doses of gunpowder"". once situated, 'take-the-ride cannon' to bloodsplatter isle. note:if you log out of the game while on bloodsplatter isle, you will log back in on bill teach's ship, docked at mos le'harmless. when you arrive on the island, the first thing you'll notice is the perch rock. investigate it and theseagull(baron von hattenkrapper), fromrocking outwill appear and forgive you for what you did to him during rocking out(you fired him out of a makeshift vacuum-accordion contraption, remember?). he wants to work with you to destroy the barrelchests, so that he can freely leave the isle. he suggests utilising yoursummoningskill to manoeuvre him over the barrelchests in order to drop cannonballs on them. when you tell him you're ready, an interface with some arrows and a bomb appears. use the arrows in the control box interface to fly over the barrelchests and destroy them. this portion of the quest can be frustrating, as the baron is not particularly agile while flying. you may find it easier to accomplish if you hide your chatbox and keep your view pointed north. there are five (5) barrelchest-mk ii's around the island that you will need to destroy. once destroyed, leave the isle and swim to bill teach on his ship. tell him the news, and he'll take you back to the island. you arrive at the dock, with the factory at the end of the boardwalk. enter the compound and approach the npc's (yellow dots on the minimap) inside the factory to get caught and thrown into the brig. use your thieving skills to escape, and loot some things from the storage area directly to the north of your cell: from here, all you can do is return to bill to talk with him some more. return to bill by using the signalling point at the end of the dock where you arrived. you'll tell him that the place is crawling with enemies, and he will suggest gathering some things to make a disguise. after talking about this, tell him that you have the things he asked for, and he'll construct abarrelchest disguisefor you. as the finishing piece, he'll stick the zombie head on top. when you have the disguise, have bill send you back to the island. use this disguise to investigate and sabotage the operations at bloodsplatter isle, gathering evidence as you go. enter the compound and change into the barrelchest disguise by clicking on the item in your inventory. there is a noticeboard in five (5) of the rooms within the compound. the player must collect letters from these boards to complete theevidence file. in order to get the letters, the player must distract or kill the guards in each room. you may be attacked bygrimterns, but they shouldn't pose much of a problem. this is where having some food or healing items with you may be helpful. after collecting all letters, change out of your disguise and return to bill by signalling him from the dock. talk to bill teach on board his ship. after taking the barrelchest disguise from you, he hands you abundle o' powder kegsto blow up the factory. ask him to return you to bloodsplatter isle so that you can complete the task. head to the eastern-most room, with the conveyor belts (the room with the red line on the minimap). pull the lever to activate the conveyor belts, and use thebundle o' kegson them continuously until each of the conveyor belts explode.  if thesado-machinistzombies reach the end of the conveyor, they will jump off and initiate combat. this can be prevented by sending a keg down the conveyor while the zombie is still on it, which kills it instantly. note that until you've destroyed all the conveyor belts, the camera stays in a fixed position and your interface might block the conveyor belt clickbox. simply rearrange your interface settings to clear this part of the quest and put everything back in position after this is done. after destroying the conveyor belts, jump the small wall between the south part of the room and the north part, and head outside to the east. run down the boardwalk, climb down the ladder, watch the short cutscene ofmi-gorandmechanical murphygetting away, and board theunoccupied zomboat. note:this battle is completely safe. if your zomboat is sunk, you will reappear on the dock with a new zomboat. however, all the zomboats you have previously sunk will respawn, and you will need to begin the battle again. once you've occupied your zomboat, set off and engage your enemies in battle.mi-gor's zomboatandmurphy's zomboattake about five (5) hits each to sink, and the other threezomboatstake two (2) hits each to sink. shoot at the enemy boats by using the available interface, or by simply clicking on the enemy boat when in range. after all hostile boats are sunk, you will return tothe adventurous. speak with bill, sail back to mos le'harmless, go back to joe's pub basement and speak to bill teach again to finish the quest. note:the minimap will again be highlighted in several places, if you have set this quest as theactivequest. head to joe's pub and you'll be all set.

now to test out the disguise. head into the penguin enclosure and talk to thepenguinwho is really an undercoverkgpagent. he will be the only penguin with a ""talk"" option. use the emote sequence that the earlier cutscene showed. if you cannot remember, or did not write down the emote sequence, then you can take off the suit and it will now be available in the quest journal. alternatively you can view the emote sequence without exiting the suit by opening the quest tab of the adventures icon in theribboninterface. otherwise, you can go by trial and error until you get it right. if you get the emote sequence wrong enough times, the correct sequence will be displayed in the quest window; at this stage your character will also tell you if you have chosen the correct emote in the sequence. fortunately, the agent responds. now apparently, penguins are trying to learn to fly and escape fromardougne zoo. the penguin gives you a mission report to return to theoutpostand asks you to also speak to the penguins inlumbridge. exit the enclosure and speak to larry to get out of the suit. when you tell him about the conversation with the penguin agent, larry ponders as to how the penguins could be hiding inlumbridge. you now need to track down the agents in lumbridge, and larry will catch up with you later. items needed:raw cod, or wearing the ring of charos. those of you who have a keen eye may already know where the penguin operatives are. if not, head tofarmer fred's sheep pasture where you find larry, standing on the western side of the farm; use the 'tuxedo-time' option with him. now head off inside the pen and locate a sheep with flippers. before speaking to them, perform the secret greeting. once you have done the greeting, the penguins still don't speak to you, demanding the secret phrase and also angry at attempting to blow their cover. speak to larry and he helps you both return to ardougne zoo. re-tuxedo before entering the penguin enclosure and speak to the penguin again. if you have araw codin your inventory, the penguin will trade the phrase for its favourite food, as explained by larry. alternatively, if you are wearing aring of charos, the penguin simply provides the phrase, and you do not get the usual (charm) option. either way, the penguin will reveal that the secret phrase is""do not trust the walrus"". return tolumbridgeand go to farmer fred's sheep pen and penguin suit up! now the penguins tell you to talk tofarmer fredto see if he's an undercover agent for the humans. speak to farmer fred about penguins and use either the bully option or warn option; both work. when you are done talking to fred, return and speak with the penguin again. pick either option in the conversation with the penguins and they give you the location of the outpost; it is on theicebergyou visited earlier under what appears to be an avalanche. they also give you the password""cabbage"". before leaving lumbridge go east to the cow pen and steal a cowbell for later in the quest. speak to larry again to be teleported to theiceberg. if you need to leave the iceberg for any reason, you can return by talking to larry again at either lumbridge or near the rock crabs east of rellekka. wear the penguin disguise again and head north-west until you see a kgp agent. use the emote greeting, then tell him the password. he then asks you for an id, which you do not have. now speak tonoodle, the black-market merchant near the kgp agent. he'll trade you akgp id cardand mission report for oneswamp tarand fivefeathers. with the counterfeit documents, speak to the kgp agent and he'll let you through. ""investigate"" the avalanche behind him to enter the outpost. once inside, go into the first room on the left and speak to the kgp agent for debriefing. he will take all 3 mission reports from you and tell you to move on through the door at the west end of the room. head up the corridor, and go through the door at the end. once through the door, the camera pans showing a penguin army! suddenly, you seem to realise their intentions are a little more devious than just flying! if you speak with thearmy commander, he tells you the penguins are ""getting ready for the invasion."" follow the signs with arrows to theagility course, and when the path ends at the checkerboard starting line, click it to start the agility course. if you want to quickly exit the course, un-equip the penguin suit, resulting in you being caught and stunned, but otherwise returned to where larry is on the iceberg. also, the surefooted aura makes this part of the quest extremely easy. speak to theagility instructor, and you are done with the agility course and free to go wherever you wish in the lair. return to larry and tell him what you've seen. he tells you that according to his new research, there is a secret room deep inside the glacier, where he thinks all the war plans are being made.  have larry put you back into the suit and return to the outpost but instead of turning left this time head straight up until you come to some massive doors. ask the kgp agent in the little control room to the left of the doors to let you in. he says his orders are to let no one go through the doors. head back down the hallway and enter the second room on the east. speak withping and pongthere, who represent penguin rebels and ask you forcowbellsand set ofpenguin bongosto replace their outdated musical instruments, as they need to make a new song. return to larry and ask him how to get cowbells and some bongos. he suggests that you steal the cowbell from adairy cowin lumbridge, zanaris (gives some fun dialogue) or rellekka (requires 15 thieving), and make the penguin bongos by usingleatheron amahogany plank. you can only make the bongos while in human form. alternatively, you can teleport to zanaris and talk to the dairy cow to receive cowbells. head back to ping and pong and provide them with the bongos and cowbells. you see acutscenewhere the two penguins play a song, producing enough sound to distract the guard at the control room. while the guard is distracted, operate the control panel where the kgp agent used to be standing to open the door. enter the war room to the north-east. you will see a cut scene of the penguins planning to take overrunescape! sadly, the penguins have set up a magical device which reveals any intruders inside the war room. the penguins in the room take your suit, and you are taken to a cage filled withicelords. they are level 42 and you need to kill a few before you are able to leave. the icelords use range as well as melee, so watch out. if you teleport out and return to larry on the iceberg, you will be re-caught and will have to fight and kill the icelords again. exit the cage through the fence door made of ice, and then exit through a chasm east of the icelord cage. talk to larry for a final time to finish the quest. the war room! your disguise is found out! the giant penguin suit... cold war is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: patch2 october 2017 (update): the concept of this quest is a parody of the real-lifecold war, a period of quiet hostility between the united states (with other western powers such as the united kingdom) and the soviet union for over 40 years. apart from the quest being named after it, the following details from the quest are references to this historical event:"

entrance of the city and talk tojex, who is nearby in front of a temple with a broken altar (the most northeastern building  in the city). he will tell you how to access the dungeons beneath the building. go down the ladder east ofjexand talk to the guard if you haven't got any lighting source already. he will sell you atorchfor 200coins, and a tinderbox for 50coins. abullseye lanternis a better choice because it will go out less often. alternatively you can take aseer's headband, as it will never go out. it is strongly recommended that you take goodfood(monkfishor above), an emergency escapeteleportsuch as theectophial(if you have access to thewar's retreat teleportyou can use that), atinderbox(can be on thetool belt), and anantipoisonor two. the dungeon under sophanem is very dangerous, and protection prayers are strongly advised for protection from the monsters that patrol the dungeon. turnauto-retaliateoff through the ability bar, since it might cause you to waste some time fighting back, and/or also cause you to run into a trap, if you're hit at an inopportune moment. go down the trapdoor and follow the dungeon around until you get to the ladder north of the south-west corner usingprotect from magicprayer. when following the route to the right, the player will only encounterscarab mages. therefore, use protect from magic and keep auto-retaliate off. the dungeon is riddled with various types of traps, which should generally be avoided or bypassed. the magic ability surge cannot be used to bypass the traps. by selecting 'search floor', these can be avoided usingagility. if you run over them without searching, you will be hit for up to 600life points. these traps can be disabled by selecting 'search odd markings', which requiresthieving. similar to the wall traps inrogues' den, be very careful to select the wall with the trap and search it. if you do not, then you will walk through (and get hit) before you're asked to disable it. if you run through them you will be hit for up to 950life points. move diagonally and carefully around them. if you run into them you will be hit for 5% of currentlife pointsof damage. these are also found in the pyramid inicthlarin's little helper. walk around the pit. if you step on these, the ground will crack open and ascarab swarmwill come out and poison you. in order to avoid these traps, walk near the opposite wall at each scarab trap on the wall. scarab magescan extinguish your light source even if it's a closed lantern, unless you are using theseer's headband. you will not be able to continue attacking (if you were in combat) until your light source is relit. once you have found the correct ladder (see map above), follow the passage around until you come tokaleef's body. search the corpse to get aparchment, read it and continue west tomaisa. once you tell her that kaleef is dead, she wants to confirm your identity before trusting you. tell her that you helped rescue prince ali, and that he was being held in draynor village. ozan and leela assisted you. she will then decide you are trustworthy and tell you to speak toosman, the spymaster inal kharid. travel to al kharid and speak to osman, who is standing against a pillar inside the palace. if you try to enter the throne room and are told the palace is on lockdown, you must first do the two quests that replaced prince ali rescue:stolen heartsanddiamond in the rough. try to convince him to come to sophanem (picking the ""it would drive a wedge between the menaphite cities."" option does the trick). when talking to osman, if you have startedthe jack of spadesbut not talked to him on the balcony on the palace, you will not get a chance to convince him to go to sophanem. to solve this issue, talk to osman on the balcony for jack of spades first and then reattempt the previous step. before returning to sophanem, make whatever arrangements are necessary to battle a level 86giant scarab. travel back to sophanem. osman is just outside the gates. talk to him again and suggest the secret entrance just north of the city. go back throughsophanem dungeonto where you found the body of kaleef. once you have passed through the maze turn auto-retaliate back on in order to avoid being interrupted in your fight. as soon as you go down the ladder you will see anothercutscenewhere a large scarab appears. travel into the cave and fight the level 86giant scarabwith 20,000 life points and no weakness. it can commonly hit into high 300s with melee and ranged. it summons level 68locust ridersandscarab mageswith 2,700 life points (which can also do 90 life points of damage with poison) to aid it, which will attack the player at the same time. the riders will attack with ranged or melee, and the mages will attack with magic so you are being attacked by all 3 combat styles at once. magic: melee: ranged: the battle site has lost most of its original safespots and cannon uses in updates. still, if you stand a distance away, the scarab will not approach. a good method is to turn on protect from range, and range it with royal dragonhide and a level 60 or higher ranged weapon. be sure to kill the riders as soon as possible, as they will be the only major threat in battle. in some apparently rare cases, you will get very lucky and the scarab will not summon a single monster to help him fight. you can protect yourself from the scarab by simply attracting the scarab then standing to the left of the skeleton right before kaleefs' body although doing this will allow the scarab to summon mages and locusts. theanti-poison totemwill not protect you from the scarab's poisonous mandibles, but other means of poison prevention, such asantipoisonpotions, will. the poison hits for around 40 life points, and can be cured with antipoisons. once the scarab is defeated, another cut scene will happen where osman is revealed to be alive (since he blended into the shadows as a spymaster). he talks to you and tells you to take thekerison the floor, and then teleports away. if you happen to die at the same time as the scarab or fail to pick up thekerisfor some other reason, you can still get it from osman in al kharid for free. go back to the high priest. it is suggested that you teleport out instead of tracing back through the dungeon, since there is no quick and easy way to get above ground. he will confirm that maisa was successful, and reward you. quest complete! contact! is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: "

the menaphite goddess,crondis. the crocodiles of the open desert have become increasingly hostile and bloodthirsty, openly and often attacking residents and travellers of theelid. this aberrant behaviour points to a change in their patron goddess, crondis, whose manner kept them passive and civil in the historic past. appease a goddess, dig deeper intoamascut's menaphite manipulations, and attempt to heal this latest plague of the devourer. items obtained forcrondiswill not be accepted if you gather them before she has demanded them. to begin, enter theuzer mastaba, found south of the ruins ofuzerand north ofnardah. make your way tosenliten, the pharaoh queen. upon asking her about the quest, she will relate a story of how once in the past she and her retinue were waylaid near theriver elidand one of her attendants was set upon by a crocodile. she realised the nature of the minor godcrondisin the crocodile's determined yet modest behaviour. however, asleelaadds, the crocodiles along theelidhave lately taken to attacking the citizens ofpollnivneachand nardah and dragging them back to the river. she notes that this may point to issues with the animals' patron goddess, but given your scepticism, she directs you to the priestjexand thesphinxinsophanemfor gathering further information. jex can be found by the doorway of the temple for the minor deities, in the north-east corner of sophanem. the sphinx roams to the north ofklenter's pyramidand will only speak to you if you have acatin your pack or following you. speak to both of them about the minor gods - you can go through all of the dialogue to learn what they know about each of the four minor deities, particularly the crocodile goddess, crondis. go through all the chat options, especially for jex, until you ""understand why she is so important."" jex has also noticed the growing brazenness of the crocodiles and believes something is in fact wrong with the deity. return tosenliten's tomband speak with her. she charges you to restore the modesty of the crocodiles, wherein you must locate crondis and resolve her problems, whatever they may be. to find the goddess, the queen permits you to take a relic she received from a genie that helped her find an oasis in the desert when she needed it. senliten informs you that the relic - a dowsing rod - is stored inside the boat replica at the mastaba's entrance passage. talk to leela to exit the temple and re-enter (by choosing the 'explore' option) to access the passages quickly. head north and loot the stone ship to obtain thedowsing rod. using the dowsing rod is similar to solving atreasure trailscompass clue. head in the direction that the arrow is pointing until you get a chat message.energy potionsormint cakescan come in handy for this part, as you will be running through a large part of the desert. click on the dowsing rods. when an arrow appears, leave the arrow there and follow it.if you close the arrow interface, the quest may glitch.you will know this is the case when you reach an oasis and your character does not start speaking. if this is the case, destroy the dowsing rods and restart this section of the quest. it is possible to teleport near the locations, such as thepharaoh's sceptreteleport to theagility pyramid(jaleustrophos) to reach sophanem and thebandit campto reach thebedabin camp. however, it's possible to break the dowsing rod's tracking by teleporting tobandit camp lodestone. after finding the three oases, it's obvious that the relic isn't working the way you need it to. return to senliten. at senliten's tomb, she realises that the relic has to be attuned to crondis before it can locate her. to do that, you have to seek out the elid elementals,tirrie,nirrieandhallakat thewater ravine dungeon, source of the river elid. leave the mastaba and head north-west, making your way to the headwaters of the elid in the desert's northern cliffs. if you have adominon medallion, you may teleport to thedominion tower, exit, and head around to its northern side. if you have atraveller's necklace, teleport to the south of thedesert eagle's eyrieand run west. using the rope, climb the waterfall and pass both sets of doors using the relic as a key. run along the shore and ask the elid elementals for their help in charging the relic. once they agree, the dowsing rod will now be able to properly locate crondis. the rod will now point you towards the south-west region of theport districtof menaphos. use of aport district teleport, thecharter shipsorshifting tombscan help reach this corner of the district faster. alternatively, if a player has aplayer-owned housein menaphos or completedlove storyquest, ateleport to house (chipped)can also be used. on the western docks, speak withportmaster kagsand he will gladly transport you to the isle of thecrondis's pyramid. head inside the pyramid to find in flesh crondis, the crocodile goddess, and tamsah, her apparently overworkedhigh priest. tamsah will secretly try to warn you about his goddess's change in behaviour (which has become decidedly less resourceful and modest), always careful not to let her overhear. as you plead crondis to intercede in the attacks of crocodiles on the desert's inhabitants, she casually insists that hungry crocodiles are nothing new. in fact, she would fancy a snack, and commands you to bring her one. youmustwait for crondis to demand a new item before collecting it. anything collected beforehand willnotbe accepted, since it would not be considered fresh enough. items you already have in the bank will not work; they must be gathered/collected at the source, only after being requested. once you obtain the resources that she demands, simply head back to the pyramid and talk to tamsah or crondis to hand over your offerings. after you deliver the 16 croc ices, crondis demands 32 more. you can either rebuke her greed or stay silent, which will allow you to quickly bank and gear up for combat before proceeding. it is recommended to stock up a full backpack on food or healing potions, as this challenger utilises a special move enabling it to steal your food items, one by one. also, the fight with ukunduka is instanced, and will not warn players if they drop items. when the fight ends, players will be sent back to the non-instanced pyramid without a chance to pick up any dropped items. when ready for the fight, return and speak to crondis. instead of agreeing to her new demand, you repeatedly refuse and rebuke her greedy behaviour. crondis swells with anger, stammers at your accusations, and before she can complete her thought, she will spit up some corruption which resolves into the form of a crocodile warrior namedukunduka. you must now fight ukunduka, who has 75,000 life points and uses both melee and ranged in combat. you cansafe spotit from the stairs leading up to crondis, and restrict it to using only ranged or magic attacks. if one chooses to use melee, only a halberd will allow use of the safe spot. as a special move, it will steal and eat food in yourbackpackand heal for that amount. food that is normally eaten in multiple bites will be eaten all at once. if you choose melee to fight him, you can carryonions,cabbagesor other cheap food to preserve your high-healing food.purple sweetsandmagnetic minnowsdo not count and ukunduka will not eat them. ukunduka's food stealing special move starts from the leftmost food item from the topmost row of your backpack, progressing to the right and then to the next row. hence, it is highly recommended to stack your cheap food at the top of your backpack, and your good healing food at the bottom. alternatively, ukunduka does not treat raw fish,saradomin brews, andbaron sharksas food, so you can use abunyipwithbunyip scroll (swallow whole)sor carry only baron sharks for healing. ukunduka will also eat mud pies and mint cakes, despite these not having a healing value associated with them; the price of these items makes this unlikely to be worth it, however. after defeating the crocodile spawn, speak with the dispossessed crondis and her much-relieved high priest. request her to address the crocodile attacks across the desert, and the goddess will agree at once. return to senliten at her tomb, where you'll findosmanarguing with leela over the handling of the problem in menaphos. leela defends her support of the queen and your aid in these events, while osman belittles your efforts, seeing his own plans as the right path. washing his hands of her, the spymaster calls for your support in the near future before departing. you relay to senliten the events that occurred in crondis' pyramid and that she is once again back to spreading restraint over her crocodile kin. though concerned withamascut's latest schemes, both the queen and leela calm down when you inform them about ozan's efforts to find the kharid-ib under menaphos. congratulations, quest complete. as

(this is the path used to get to the ice gate indesert treasurebut keep going north to reachlamistard's tunnels. do not take the path with the boulder, as that leads to thegod wars dungeoninstead.) go in through the cave entrance and walk through the ice caves. these caves are populated with level 84+ ice trolls, and caution is recommended for lower level players. at the end of the tunnel, head through the crevasse and continue east to the next cave entrance. walk through the tunnel, clearing the rubble. some pieces must be mined from more than one side to clear them. there are one-, two- and three-rock piles. some three-rocks may be mined perfectly; some might cause a cave-in to the east which cannot be mined. to get to the end you must mine every piece of rubble from every angle you have access to. progress is saved, but if the player leaves the cave, the rocks will be reset. walk to the room in the east of the cave. pick up the four tablets on the ground along the way:stone tablet,granite tablet,slate tablet, andshale tablet.it is recommended to bank the tablets at the next convenient point so that they can be given to ali the wise after the quest. once in the basement, search the bookcases to getnotes (a-j)about themahjarratand go up the stairs. be sure to have two open inventory slots before going up the stairs and fightingarrav. speak to arrav, but he cannot control his body, so he starts to attack. he has a combat level of 91 and attacks withmelee, soprotect from meleeis suggested. he will talk between every few attacks. when arrav has about 50% of his health remaining, he will temporarily regain some control over his body, and he will give instructions to search the flame tapestry in the southern room.zemouregalwill then call him, and he will be teleported away. head to the room directly south and search the tapestry on the western wall with the candles next to it to receive abase keyand thebase plans. return to ali the wise in nardah. show him the base plans, and a cutscene will start of ali explaining all the traps in the base and a walkthrough of where to go. human detection spells sewage system under the base surges of energy sent through the waters gas fills the area when alarm is sounded five-inch thick runite-enforced steel door fire ray enchantments arrav's heart, in the middle of a continuous mahjarrat spell from ali the wise's house, head north-east to theuzer mastaba.senlitenis located on the lower level of the uzer mastaba;

venturing into the depths of thetemple of aminishi,dragonkin laboratory, andthe shadow reef. the following are not required tostartthe quest, butmust be done to complete it: start the quest by speaking tobryll thoksdottirnear therewards traderatdaemonheim. she explains that signs of something apocalyptically big have been found by a network of informants. her mysterious informant, the 'jade spider', is a resident of the arc, and she has been talking to them by letter and carrier seagull. she tasks you with locating them, and for that you must first travel towaiko. head towaikoto look for clues to find the 'jade spider'. you may speak to the shopkeepers to try and find information on the spider, and will eventually be led tozhuka, the bamboo merchant who is in the south-eastern part of the main square. she will hurriedly tell you to travel towhale's mawand speak to her contact there for more information, as she is afraid of drawing too much attention to herself. once on whale's maw, you must locate a villager who knows something about the jade spider. talk tosea witch kaula, on the north-west side of the island, who explains that the jade spider gave her a message to give to you, but it is buried nearby. dig on the western-most sand pile next to the nearby destroyed boat on the island and you will discover a tunnel with turtle tracks heading into it. there are scraps of paper left behind, indicating that the note that had been left for you has been stolen by a nearbytortle. check the nearby tortle that occasionally has messages over its head and retrieve the note from its mouth to receive anote from the jade spider. the note explains that there is an infection running throughthe arcin the form of a sinister cult, and that the jade spider has given their location to a trusted friend. you must find the friend and tell them ""the oyster is open"" for them to know that it's you. the note concludes by telling you that you can find the friend ontuai leit. sail to tuai leit and speak tosensei seaworth, who is the friend, and he tells you to find jade spider ongoshima. attempt to sail to goshima, and you will be prompted to search for the jade spider. once on goshima, you will discover the beach is swarming with 12 crassianwarriorsandscouts. to progress, all twelve of them must be killed. they are found all over the accessible part of the island, so try not to miss any. once all of them have been killed, you will hear a clonking, clicking noise from the gate of the island's town, gongdung. head into gongdung, and speak tomadame shihin the eastern house, who reveals she is the jade spider, and that the dark force threatening gielinor is known asthe ambassador, and that the order in thetemple of aminishiis connected to it. she tells you to go and investigate the temple, and learn its secrets. to progress in the quest, you will now need to complete thetemple of aminishiin any mode, which includes story mode. however, if you have already completed a run of the temple of aminishi, you will be presented with the option to skip this part of the quest. once the temple of aminishi has been completed, return to madame shih to tell her about the activities of the cult and what happened toseiryu. she will be enraged, and tell you that her agents discovered a stone tablet on the aminishi beach, written in the language of thedragonkin. she gives it to you and suggests you find someone able to translate it while she tries to discover more about the ambassador. make your way to thevarrock museumand go to the basement. behind the stairs, you will find a door leading tomr mordaut(talking to mr mordaut onanachroniawill not work). speak to him and show him the dragonkin tablet. he will tell you it is part of a map relating to a dragonkin laboratory, and that it indicates another part of the map is safeguarded by awhite-scaled alchemistbeneath a cold, frozen mountain to the north-east. travel back to daemonheim, and go to the small ruined village down the stairs south of the main fremennik camp. investigate thefountainthat resembles a fish there, and you will discover it has two strange holes where its eyes should be. search thefireplaceto the east in the ruins, and you will receivecarved dragonstone (left). use this on the fountain, and then carve your own uncut dragonstone into thecarved dragonstone (right). use this dragonstone on the fountain, and the crumbling watchtower up the stairs to the west will be unlocked. enter it and you will arrive inkerapac's laboratory. once you enter the dungeon, go west and speak tohannibus, who reveals that he is searching for kerapac after he gave him a serum to help with his race's infertility. he will give you another part of the tablet that you are missing, and explains that it is written in a crude representation of the dragon language. it says something about ""where the armoured dragons are made"", but he does not know to what that refers. be sure to hold on to yourring of kinshipordungeoneering cape, as you will need to teleport back to daemonheim after you are finished with the next part. head to theadamant dragon dungeon, accessed via thebrimhaven dungeon. you can get there quickest by using ametallic dragon trinketto teleport toadamant dragons(if you do so, you need to ascend the stairs and go back down), or alternatively using thehoardstalker ringordungeoneering capeto teleport to thebrimhaven dungeon resource dungeon. if those options are unavailable, you can simply use thekaramjalodestoneto teleport close to the entrance to brimhaven dungeon. once inside, you will be greeted by hannibus, who is horrified with the numerousdead adamant dragonslittered around the dungeon. there are many objects to investigate in the surrounding rooms. hannibus will give you suggestions on what to do next if you speak to him. themetallic objectcontaining a piece of the map can be obtained by reaching in the mouth of themithril smelterinside the east room of the dungeon, but it needs to be heated to retrieve the map instead. for this, hannibus will help you speak with theadamant dragon motherin the western-most room; the only survivor of the dungeon's attack by adventurers. talk to her about heating the metallic object, and tell her that it is one of her babies that needs warmth; and she will breathe dragonfire on it, turning it into ametallic object (heated). with a rope, head to the pits north of the staircase and lower the object in it to receive ametallic object (brittle). then use it on the giant stone dragon head in the north-west corner of the room with the staircase to break it, and receive another part of the tablet. hannibus is still unable to completely decipher the map, but indicates it has a drawing of something he saw back at kerapac's laboratory at daemonheim. return there to search for clues. open the door to the central section of the first room of the dungeon, and investigate the effigy shelves to meet a talkingeffigy. it will explain that you need to activate the right combination of dragonkin statues to follow kerapac through a portal he went through in the portal chamber. there are five dragonkin statues which you can activate throughout the area. in order to start the puzzle, open the door in the centre room with hannibus and talk to the effigy on the effigy shelves about finding clues. the objective of the puzzle is to activate all four portals, directing energy at the centre of the room. if you activate a statue, you can also activate it again to revert the changes. refer to the image to the right numbering the statues. start in the southeastern most room, and activate the statue (5) in the centre area. then proceed to the southern area of the room where the statue is located behind the door (4).  move one room west and activate statue (3). then move one room north and one room west  to activate statue (2). in short, activate statues numbered 5, 4, 3, and 2, in this order, and the puzzle is solved. another solution is to activate statues numbered 1, 3, and 5. if you tried the first solution, you can just deactivate the unnecessary ones and the portal will open. this implies that it is not the order of activation, but the activation state of the statues that matters. after completing the puzzle, a portal in the northern room will open. after entering the portal you arrive onmount firewakeonkethsiwhere a cutscene ensues. kerapac will give a speech to his entourage that accompanied him duringsliske's endgame. since kerapac destroyed thestone of jas, the other dragonkin regard him as their hero. kerapac tells the attendees that they must set aside any petty differences they had before, and that they must work together and take a stand againsttheir captors. once the cutscene ends, speak to kerapac. you will show him the tablet, and he reminiscences about the experiments that went ""horribly wrong"". though he refuses to tell you about the ambassador and doesn't give you the final piece of the map, he instead tells you exactly where it leads: thedragonkin laboratoryin the north-easternwilderness. he then tells you to leave while he remains with hannibus to tell him how to properly administer the serum. return to bryll thoksdottir in daemonheim and inform her what you have learned so far, and that kerapac pinpointed the dragonkin laboratory in the wilderness as the next location to travel towards. to progress in the quest, you will need to complete thedragonkin laboratoryin any mode, which includes story mode. however, if you have already completed a run of the dragonkin laboratory, you will be presented with the option to skip this part of the quest. when the dungeon is completed, return to bryll at daemonheim, and update her on what you have learned. next you will need to return to goshima to catch up withmadame shih, but upon arrival you will be confronted by thethe ambassador. during the cutscene, the ambassador will kill madame shih's crew. shih immediately wants to avenge her men and teleports out before you can object to her actions. return to bryll at daemonheim, and she informs you a council has been set up to immediately confront this problem. you will be taken to the dock to the east, with bryll, hannibus,quartermaster gullyandbosun higgsto discuss the plan to kill the ambassador inthe shadow reefin thecursed archipelago, for which you'll need to find a way to breathe underwater. she recommends you speak to the hydromancerwizard myrtle. talk towizard myrtle, just outside thewizards' towerindraynor village. she tells you that she cannot help in your mission, as the location is too far and she is unwilling to travel to thecursed archipelagofor unsaid reasons. however, she recalls a potion recipe that allows for breathing underwater, it has cryptic instructions on how to make it. she will give you anempty vialto capture 'the winds of winter', as well as magical seaweed that needs to be dried under 'divine blinding light'. then you'll need to combine those ingredients with a 'resident of the depths you wish the traverse'. with all of the ingredients collected, simply click 'combine' to mix them into apotion of waterbreathing, which you should now drink. return to hannibus at the war table near thefremennik ship (shadow reef)in the eastern part of daemonheim. (if he is not there, instead talk tobryll thoksdottir, which will progress the quest). he will tell you that they need to destroy the artillery the ambassador has set up above the shadow reef, and for that you will need to enlist the help of theking black dragon. head to edgeville, activate the artefact northwest of the lodestone, and select the option to visit the king black dragon along with hannibus to enter an instanced dialogue where you recruit the dragon's help. hannibus asks the king black dragon if he knows of any further dragons that could help, but he replies that he has been unaware of other dragons' activities. head back to varrock museum and speak with mr. mordaut. mordaut will be honoured by hannibus' visit, who asks him if he knows of anyone who could help. mordaut tells him that he doesn't know of any dragons, but he does know of a dragon rider fighting for zaros' forces in thekharidian desert. hannibus will be immediately alerted by the mention and tells you to meet him at theheart of gielinor, promising to speak with mordaut more when the situation is less dire. head into the heart of gielinor and enter the instanced version. you may need to exit via the lift in the heart and re-enter to trigger the option. hannibus will meet with the dragon rider,vindicta. vindicta is surprised by hannibus' small build, though she initially shuns them because they have resigned to their fate. hannibus then asks her about her origins; vindicta replies that she was kept safe bygorvekand that her mother wasmorvannon, and her father was hannibus. hannibus realises that vindicta is his daughter, though vindicta refuses to believe that. however, she is impressed with his feats and learns of the ambassador's threats to gielinor, having heard some of it from zaros. she decides to join the strike force for the thrill of the fight. return back to the war table on the east side of daemonheim and talk with hannibus. afterwards, talk with bryll once again who will tell the player thatquartermaster gullywants a word. he asks the player to help his seagull steven go see his wife and children and tell them he loves them. head to the north-east corner ofwaikoisland near thewaiko moaiand talk tosteven's wife. she claims to have moved on from steven, and is now in a relationship withcount ludwig koppenploppen, who you might have met earlier inpieces of hate. you will then need to find evidence about count ludwig's shady character from the other seagulls around the island to save steven's marriage. talk to steven's wife again, who is horrified of what the count has done. he proudly admits to his wrongdoings before flying off. steven and his wife then make amends with each other. return to quartermaster gully at any location;

after a short, but heated conversation, crane appears from behind and the two torture and kill him. speak to crane a final time, who will direct you back to bryll for the next step. with all of the group now ready to fight the ambassador's forces on the surface while you head underwater to fight him directly, bryll directs you to make a speech to your forces to inspire them for the upcoming battle. you may use any chat options to make the speech without affecting the result. once the speech is over, you will need to completethe shadow reefin any mode, which includes story mode. however, if you have already completed a run of the shadow reef, you will be presented with the option to skip this part of the quest. the option to skip this part appears both before and after giving the speech. if you do not have a high combat level, it is recommended to complete the shadow reef in story mode, which can be done in a group. when doing the shadow reef in story mode, the health of all monsters is reduced by 50% and their damage output is also reduced by 90%. for the information about the shadow reef, see thestrategy guide. a run will not count if you are not in any one of the main three boss instances. similar to normal boss fights, the kill won't register if you do not inflict any damage to the boss and you'll have to redo the dungeon. after the shadow reef has been cleared and the ambassador's ritual stopped, return to bryll at daemonheim and speak to her. madame shih will then appear and thank you for avenging her crew. she will explain that she attempted to go and fight the ambassador herself, but was captured by his forces. she also explains that she had been corrupted back when she was withrabid jackin ulthven kreath, and had a desperate obsession to kill the ambassador, which has gone silent now. hannibus will then talk to you about his excitement about being a father, and how he intends to stay on gielinor for a while and attempt to be a parent to vindicta. bryll will then congratulate you for saving the world, and offer you a drink. after unlocking the goshima gate and visiting the island outside of quest mode, anazure keycan be found in the eastern trunk north of the north-easternmost building in the town. this key can be used to grant access to theazure room, a hidden room within thetemple of aminishi. the door is on floor 1, whereoyu the quietestspawns. in addition to various lore found in the room, traversing further through the azure room corridor leads to a previously inaccessible north-eastern island ofaminishi. there are skilling spots forbamboo,north-east aminishi mine, and a bank deposit box in the south-east by the dock. players may dig at a mound located on the northern shoreline ofaminishito find atrunk keywhich can be used to open thetrunklocated in the azure room. this contains: looting  the trunk completesa mini shipmentachievement. curse of the black stone is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

this time, whisper that you really need to meet the myreque, to which they will redirect you toold man ral, who is in the middle of sector one. they tell you to tell him that a friend sent you, so that he feels important. old man ralis in the house with the green-startaskssymbol on the minimap. nearby you can also findtrader svenwho is a black market trader and cansellyou a set ofcitizen clothingorvyrewatch clothing, which will reduce the frequency at which the vyrewatch take an interest in you. speak to old man ral, who answers every question with another question and refuses to tell you about the myreque, or anything at all for that matter. tell him that ""someone told me you could help me"" then say his nickname is the 'sage of the sanguinesti'; flattered, he will eventually tell you to ""follow the symbols"" to get into the third sector, where the myreque reside. you now need to make a complex journey across the city – watch for the sickle marks (if you have trouble seeing them, switch tomidday skyboxby right clicking on the world map and selecting ""skybox/filters""), or simply follow the instructions below (you may click each of the steps below as you do it to track your progress). most actions give 5 agility experience. walk west around the corner, pastmekritus a'hara, and into the room withflaygian screwteandvertida sefalatis. speak to vertida. he will ask why you are here. tell him you are a friend of the myreque and that you are here to help, and he will give you amessageto take toveliaf hurtzback inburgh de rott. get back toburgh de rottany way you see fit, and talk toveliaf hurtzin the basement of the pub again. he will read the message – the myreque stands strong but is weakened and the vampyres seem to be getting fresh victims. he will tell you to talk todrezelinpaterdomusfor advice, since strange noises have recently been heard around the temple and people have gone missing. he will also tell you to speak toking roaldinvarrock palacefor military help in battling the vampyres. make sure that you ask veliaf what he wants you to do next. a fast way to reach paterdomus from burgh de rott is using theinvitation boxfrommissing, presumed deathor by going through thetemple trekkingminigame. veliaf hints you to it when you ask him for tips. any other route, such as using the canifis lodestone teleport, will do as well to complete the quest. go todrezel, who is in the catacomb beneath the temple; he will say that he andivan stromhave been hearing strange noises, almost animal voices, outside the temple and would like you to investigate, preferably to the west of the stairs. he will also say that people have gone missing while at thesilvarea mining site. finally he exclaims his praise over ivan and sees in him his successor as paterdomus's protector. exit the mausoleum (northern exit), go southwest to the church entrance staircase, and infront of the right statue look for a bush that is searchable. search the bush, a shortcutscenewill follow where you will find an unconscious man and then be knocked out by ashadowy figure. two werewolves have managed to get across theriver salveand are ""collecting"" humans to pay the extrablood titheswhichgadderankshad mentioned duringin aid of the myreque. return todrezeland tell him what you have just seen. it is very grave news indeed. he tells you to speak toking roaldand gives yourunesfor avarrock teleportspell. if you want, you can return to veliaf now to inform him of the news – he will be shocked and urge you to go to the king at once. go tovarrockcastle and speak withking roald– he's on the ground floor on the east side. you will briefly explain the cause of the myreque and how lowerniel drakan is terrorising the people of morytania. roald is shocked and agrees they need help, but his advisoraeonisig raispherintervenes and notes that misthalin cannot help them if these people aren'tsaradominist. roald will agree, but you manage to convince him that religion does not matter in such horrible situation. you then mention the two werewolves who crossed theriver salveand whom you could not kill, as roald assumed. he is now convinced and decides to set up an army against morytania. but once again, aeonisig disagrees and tells him that warfare against morytania will disrupt balance and possibly cause another god war. he also says that there is no proof lord drakan has actually invaded misthalin. he also does not find you trustworthy as you were knocked out. roald angrily responds that they must do something for the people, but aeonisig tells it is impossible due to theedicts of guthix. after a fruitless conversation, aeonisig decides to ""begin with the paperwork"" and thechurch of saradominbegins looking into the edicts. sadly, roald agrees, although he will set up amercenary protocolso that adventurers may battle the vampyric forces with his blessing. meanwhile, they will study the edicts in order to rid the world of drakan. ask him some questions about the procedures, then he will offer you a free teleport back to paterdomus. accept and aeonisig will teleport you. speak todrezelagain. he will be sad, but he hadn't considered the edicts before. he can explain some more about them, telling you that most political leaders have spiritual advisors that help them maintain the balance of the world in accordance with the edicts lest thedruidsand other guthixians wake up the god of balance from his slumber so that he can completely reshape the world, then ask you to report back to the myreque. he also notes that more refugees from morytania have beenpassingthrough the temple into misthalin recently, and wonders if it is due to your actions. go back toburgh de rottand speak toveliaf hurtzagain. tell him about the werewolf attack and about the edicts and the protocol. he will be shocked about the werewolves' having crossed the salve, and blame the refusal of misthalin to aid directly on political games before asking you to quickly forward this news to the leader of the sanguinesti division in the myreque hideout there. go back tovertida sefalatisinmeiyerditch. the easiest way to do this is to deliberately get caught by the vyrewatch, then tell them to take you to themeiyerditch mine. if you are struggling to get their attention, try exiting to the lobby and rejoining the world. if you choose to go the mines, you must mine 15 stackabledaeyalt ores, place them into a mine cart, and then talk to one of thejuvinate guardsto leave. you will now find yourself in the northern part of the city. run south and enter the house marked on the map (see right; enlarging the minimap means you can click on the house you need to run to). this house has abucket of waterinside. leave through the south door, then enter the house directly south. climb up the ladder, jump the floorboard to the east, and then climb down the stairs. once you push the wall to the south of the stairs, you will find yourself at the entrance to the hideout. push the decorated wall from the south side, then open the southeastern lumpy rug. vertida sefalatis will then tell you to talk to his friend and the leader,safalaan, who is nearcastle drakan. he will tell you to go there using the vyrewall and that a certain barricade can be opened temporarily using a wall switch just south-east of it. he will offer to lead you to sector 1 of the city, and you will appear on the first floor of the first house marked with a sickle. head back to the southern coast, climb over the wall rubble, then climb the floor to the south to get back up onto the wall. then travel all the way north until you cannot go any further and go down the ladder. search the rocky surface east of the ladder, and the barricade to the north will unlock. simply try to open the barricade to go through it. go north, and then climb a ladder. on the wall, go north, up a ladder and back down another to cross a gap. keep going north until you see a long ladder against a high wall, climb it, then head north until you seesafalaan. after you introduce yourself as a myreque associate, you tell him about the werewolf attack and the edicts. he finds both matters rather suspicious, as drakan should have launched a full invasion by now if he had managed to cross the salve, and the guthixian edicts had been used as an excuse not to send aid before. he returns to the base to discuss these matters and requests that you sketch the castle in three places – north, then west, then south; there are sickle symbols on the ground to tell you where to sketch. he gives you somepapyrusandcharcoalto make the drawings with. he also mentions that old man ral has more papyrus should you run out for some reason, although the myreque base also has a crate with papyrus. head west along the path and travel around to the north part of the castle and stand on the sickle. use the charcoal on the papyrus here to make thefirst sketch. you will see a short cutscene of vanstrom klause talking tovanescula drakanandranis drakan. they will drink some fresh blood and then fly away. go to the west side of the castle and make thesecond sketchon the sickle emblem. go the south side of the castle and attempt to make another drawing on the sickle emblem near where safalaan was. you will be spotted andvanstrom klausewill attack and, after around 3–5 turns, knock you out but not kill you. like with the vyrewatch, you cannot damage him. wearing aring of lifeat this stage will teleport you away as you near death, requiring you to come all the way back and repeat the step. usingprotect from meleeordeflect meleewill stop most damage, but his attacks are fairly weak. when he knocks you out, a lady calledsarius guilewill save you. do not click away when you're knocked out or you will have to redo the fight. fighting vanstrom! sarius saves you. when you recover,sarius guilewill speak to you.vanesculadid not actually request to save your life, but she does have a strange interest in safalaan. as a favour in return, she will ask to deliver him a message and give you a long-winded hint about where to find it near a place of smoke and statues, then disappear. remember to make thethird and final sketchof the castle before leaving this area. deliver the sketches to safalaan, who has returned to the meiyerditch base. the quickest way to return is to get noticed by the vyrewatch, get sent to the mine, and then go southeast to the hideout as before. safalaan will be grateful and ask you to find the message sarius spoke of. exit the hideout, push the wall, climb up the stairs, jump the floorboard, go down the ladder, then head to the building directly southwest with a ladder and with the fireplace opposite a portrait of a vyre statue; use aknifeon the fireplace on the northern wall of the room to get themessage(tool belt works). and read it. it will speak of an abandoned laboratory in the north-east of meiyerditch where vampyres did experiments to acquire more blood, using human slaves to work for them. at some point, the laboratory was abruptly shut down and its location hidden due to a discovery that even the vampyres feared. the author's coworkers disappeared and he hid himself, commenting that he was hunted by the vampyres. he finally reveals the location of the laboratory and signs his letter;mauritys guile. you can also slash the vyrewatch portrait to the south to get thelarge ornate keybefore you leave to save yourself a trip before heading to safalaan and the laboratory. make your way back tosafalaanin the base. he will ask you to see if you can find the laboratory. the laboratory is located north-east oftrakerel's fish shopand east of theskull in a chest inn. the hideout is in the room with the yellow and red tapestry. if you get a message when using the knife on the tapestry saying: ""you see no reason to destroy this lovely looking tapestry"", then you need to show the message to safalaan. the house where you found the message (the one with the fireplace) contains a portrait of the exact same vyrewatch, except she's holding a key. search and slash the portrait on the southern wall of this house to get alarge ornate key. go back to the house with the tapestry and use the key on thestatue. donotuse the key on the east door, or else you will suffer an electric shock and take 100 life points of damage. fireplace and portrait red and yellow tapestry the portrait of the vyrewatch statue the statue with the key the abandoned lab open the door to the east and go down the stairs – you will find yourself in the laboratory. search the broken rune case west of stairs you came down for 3air, 1law, 1water, 1mind, and 3fire runes. usetelekinetic grabon thehaemalchemybook on the table near the broken tube. it is too difficult to understand, however. take the book back to safalaan. he will be very happy and thankful and gives you ashortcut keyand tell you to return toveliaf hurtzwith asealed message, as a last task. go back toburgh de rott. if you decide to return to burgh de rott via the meiyerditch, along the route there will be two doors with a key painted on them. the shortcut key unlocks these for faster travel (seemeiyerditch shortcut guide). speak toveliaf hurtzin the basement of the pub once you reach burgh de rott to find out that safalaan has promoted you to myreque private in the message. congratulations, quest complete! the darkness of hallowvale is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:   "

inspect all three and return to anne, who will strengthen the memory slightly and ask you to strengthen it further by collecting six wisps. once these six wisps are collected, she will ask you to enter the memory, much to your disdain. there, you'll control moia and arrive at a mahjarrat camp led bybilrach. moia reports to bilrach over the decimation of a demon camp near theblack knights' fortresswith plenty of success, along with eliminating a varrockian patrol group near the wilderness border. bilrach advises moia not get the wrath of the new basilissa, but moia appears to disregard this just as she hears enemies approaching. demons and their human followers will emerge around the camp and engage bilrach's forces in battle. you will need to eliminate nine enemies, consisting of chaos witches, chaos demons and zamorakian cultists. moia has access to three abilities to increase her damage; she deals 9,000 damage per auto-attack. she also has access to three abilities: when an enemy is killed, they will drop a healing orb, which can be taken to restore health. if moia's health fully depletes, the player can reattempt at an easier difficulty. once the last enemy is slain by moia, the remaining enemies die off. speak to bilrach, who cursesk'ril tsutsarothfor betraying him and trying to wrestle control of the zamorakian faction before realising that someone is coordinating the attacks and orders moia to eliminate whoever is doing so. moia will comply and head off to complete her task. moia appeared in the warbands camp. enakhra,general khazardand moia were in the warbands camp. the tracks will lead to the red dragon isle itself. while the memory found isn't as weak, it isn't strong enough and anne tasks you with finding memories to strengthen it, done the same as the previous cycle. in this memory, bilrach states that the forces of thechaos templewere eliminated by demons from the north and west, and thus has decided to fall back to daemonheim, much to moia's anger. moia reports that she discovered some stragglers and bilrach orders her to finish them. there are six enemies, consisting of two each of witches, demons and cultists. once the last enemy is killed, moia will remark on looking for survivors; a wounded cultist will be near the two demons. moia interrogates the cultist, learning thatavaryss, the unceasingis coordinating the attacks from theinfernal source. moia then proceeds to drain the cultist of energy before adrasteia seemingly appears before her, before she reappears astrindine. trindine laughs at moia for following a senile fool and scuttling across the empire's ashes. moia states that she knows her purpose and that trindine serves an irrelevant time. trindine then offers assistance, stating that she doesn't really have much of a choice as demons simply come back when they die. she offers her a diabolus (phylactery) but refuses to divulge what she wants in return. with no other choice and seeing that they could bargain with k'ril and strike fear into his other generals, moia accepts. moia then informs bilrach of her development. bilrach is surprised, having expected better of avaryss, but orders moia to deal with her painfully. he asks if she has anything else to report, but she doesn't. the two of you will arrive at the wilderness volcano crater where both of you spot a massive rift and that moia was just here; however, the portal is sealed, so interact with the memory. you will control moia again and confront avaryss at the hydra's gate, who summons four chaos demons to assist her. moia will use the diabolus to kill the chaos demons and capture their souls, much to avaryss' shock as she demands where she got it from. avaryss has 500,000 health; unlike the normal encounter, she uses magic. start withblastto quickly deal 25,000 damage, then avaryss will summon two greater demon reinforcements after a few seconds, both of whom have 80,000 health. killing these greater demons will each drop a healing orb that restores 2,475 lifepoints. she will periodically surge across the arena and may drop chaos vortices, expelling damaging magic.vaultaway from these while usingdrainandblastto survive and end the encounter quickly. after dying, there is an option to make the battle easier, just like the previous combat encounters. wearing thearmour of trialsdoes not reduce damage after death. once avaryss' health reaches 0, she states that the other zamorakian mahjarrat would never treat her as an equal before moia absorbs avaryss' soul into the diabolus. while you were investigating the memory, anne managed to break the seal on the portal and had brought you inside, where moia is still waiting and reveals anne as trindine. talk to moia; regardless of your choices, moia states that she is tired of being disrespected and treated improperly, and thus plans to make gielinor fear her new powers. she will open a rift out of the source, which you and trindine will follow; however, you'll end up back where you started to track moia. this is my time. now it's time for the world to struggle against me. moia opened a rift and escaped through it. trindine will tell you to inform adrasteia of the development. she can be spoken to further, upon which the zarosians had affiliated with adrasteia as they wanted to strive for peace and wanted to help her traitorous brethren out to ensure that both they and the demons would continue fighting and killing each other instead of harming bystanders. however, she had miscalculated moia's threat but plans to continue monitoring both bilrach and moia's actions. return to falador and inform adrasteia of the news. adrasteia had her suspicions of anne being someone else, but does admit that the zarosians are aligned with them in achieving peace, whereas the zamorakians only want destruction. she intends to call you once again once she has another plan ready, rewarding you for your efforts. congratulations, quest complete! daughter of chaos(0) – complete this quest. daughter of chaos is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: everything changed when the gods were banished from this world. as basilissa, it is my responsibility to safeguard the human kingdoms and maintain their alliance. but our unity is already under threat. without a clear leader, the zamorakians have descended into civil war. even as we speak, they battle for control of the wilderness. better that they're killing each other than our people, but the conflict isn't contained. a mahjarrat lieutenant has been slaughtering varrock's patrols near the border. moia. though she serves bilrach, i believe she poses the bigger threat. we must prove to the kingdoms that i can protect them. travel into the wilderness, find moia, and stop her."

he tasks you with finding material to build a bridge to the vault you saw earlier inunwelcome guests. enter the area to the west where thearmoured phantomswould be and search all sixspooky holesindicated by red dots on theminimap. as the last hole is searched, threematerial ghoulswill appear; kill them for the last three pieces of materials. the nine ""materials"" do not take up any room in yourbackpack. then, construct thebridge, which will be immediate. investigate and search theancient doorand you will note that there is a more subtle way to open the door. push one of thepillarsand switch to the raptor to control him. while your character is still at the pillar, push the other as the raptor to unlock the seal, after which adragonkin devicewill pop out of the door. search the door again to receive it. the raptor will tell you to bring it toreldowho can be found in thevarrock palacelibrary; enter the portal in front of the library door. reldowill investigate the device and state that it is a dream device made by thedragonkin, which could be entered by looking into one of the facets until sleepy.the raptorimmediately looks into one and collapses. reldo will tell you that he is now in his worst fears and you will go in to save him, after he gives you apotion of dreamless sleepto ensure you wouldn't be stuck in your own nightmares too. inside the raptor's dream realm, you will control both yourself and the raptor. you will need to make your way to the house, unlocking the barriers by depressing allpressure platesin that section. each time you open a barrier, you get access to another boulder that can be moved into place to depress one pressure plate. the raptor can pushbouldersat a rate of five tiles per push, while the player can move one tile per push. both characters only move boulders one tile per pull. unlock the two pre-placed boulders by placing both characters on the plates outside each one, then move them into place on the ones by the barrier. when the first barrier is removed, astrange girland silhouettes of amanand awomanwill appear. you will ask who they are, but the raptor refuses to divulge their identities. for the second barrier, place the raptor on one pressure plate; you will be moving the boulders to their spots, as they will despawn if the pressure plate is relieved. once the boulders are on a barrier pressure plate they are locked in and do not respawn, the two plates at the gate posts are exactly one raptor push from the spawn location. switch to the raptor to push them into location before moving yourself to the next one. the two strange adults will then run into the house, for reasons unknown. for the third barrier, place yourself on one of the plates, then have the raptor move the boulder. once the first boulder is placed, place yourself on the second pressure plate. switch to raptor and place him on the third pressure plate. then the adults will be burned to death, prompting the raptor to hurry up. the other boulder will appear; place it on a plate, and with all 4 plates occupied, the barrier disappears. head to the house, where the raptor will reveal that the child is actually her and the graves are her parents, before you realise that the raptor is queenellamariaherself. ellamaria was not content with the life of a royal, and thus adopted the identity of the raptor as a compromise to also help protect her husband. learning why you came, she suggests venturing deeper into the realm to investigate further. interact with thedim lightand an assortment of threedream biancas,dream raptors,dream roald nightmares, andnightmareswill emerge to attack. currently this part is glitched if you are in a group, which will prevent the player from progressing as expected. simply leaving the group and re-entering the instance will allow progress. during this segment, the raptor and the player are effectively one combatant, with the raptor sharing the health, buffs, summons, etc. as the player. however, only the player character can attack enemies at high health, and when they are at low health, only the raptor can finish them off, so you need to switch back and forth a few times. as the final nightmare is slain, interact with thepillar of light, whereking roaldappears and states that their time will not last forever before he dies, which confuses ellamaria. continue following down the path and interact with another dim light, causing more enemies to appear; finish them off as before, and interact with the pillar of light, causingbiancato appear. she accuses ellamaria of treating the people like dirt and that she did not deserve her title. further down the path still, five nightmares will appear after interacting with the dim light; kill them off, then talk to the raptor illusion, who accuses ellamaria of being weak and useless. as it leaves, the dream then changes and revealszemouregallooking at someancient writings. you will read it and find thedragonkin words""draekeun vorkath skek pthen"", which are successfully translated as ""dragon vorkathnecromancy"" after a few iterations, and realise that they might be the words needed to open the door. alarmed, you will tell the raptor to return to thecrypt. you will arrive at thecryptwith thetwo guardsstationed outside killed, slain byzemouregal. enter the crypt and go through thenow unlocked door, which zemouregal had opened while you were gone. inside, you will find an ancient dragonkin tomb filled with the remains of many dragons. enter the centre room to find amap tablewhich was disturbed. investigate it, then slay tenfetid zombiesaround the crypt and deposit the pieces on the table (if you didn't go through the dialogue you cannot attack them). you will then need to solve the puzzle in a manner similar to thepuzzle boxesfound intreasure trails. you can toggle accessibility mode by talking tothe raptor; this will make tiles which are correctly placed turn red. once the map is complete, you and the raptor will recognise it as an island in thelunar sea, though not sure as to which island it is. the raptor will suggest speaking tooverseer sivand reminds you not to let others know of her true identity, which you accept. talk tooverseer sivabout the island, who will tell you that the island is known asungaeland that thefremennikfear the island, as it is said to be guarded by a powerful dragon. nonetheless, after learning why you andthe raptorintend to go there, she agrees to find someone who would charter a ship there. speak to the raptor and inform him of your discovery, and thus you will need to wait and prepare until the time is right. congratulations, quest complete! dead and buried is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: wallpaper"

(currently there is a glitch whereby lowland heather can not actually be seen in low - mid graphic detail, this includes the item in your inventory but you can still click it) return to 'the guns' and hand him the newly brewed potion. satisfied, he will offer to return you back to the fishing guild to meet with jones. after returning to the fishing guild and speaking with jones, he will take the party out to sea. the small vessel will arrive at the wreckage, and certain wrecks must be investigated to reveal parts of thalassus's trail. this process is identical to the method oftrackingvarious animals inhunter. instead of paw prints follow the trail of debris. investigating the correct wreckage at the end of the debris will reveal a new debris trail. the curiosity bar fills with each wrong investigation and 5 mistakes are allowed when investigating the trail. should you investigate the wrong wreck 5 times, the trail will reset, but the correct solution will remain the same. in addition to the option to investigate the ship wrecks, various items may be looted from the wreckages. seethalassuspage for possible solutions to finding him. after completing the trail to uncover thalassus, the monster will surface, knock you and jones overboard, and swallow jones. after washing up onto the shore of a small island, threemermaidswill mock the expedition and reveal their loyalty to thalassus. the mermaids are rather confident and must be convinced that jones, with hisgiant harpoon, poses a great danger to thalassus now that he rests in the belly of the monster. to diminish the confidence of the mermaids, the following dialogue options must be chosen: choosing a different option from the ones listed above will reset the mermaids' confidence and require you to start the dialogue over. after instilling fear into the mermaids, they will insist on tracking thalassus down once more in order to force jones from the beast's bowels. upon arriving on the boat, it is necessary to track the creature a second time. when tracking thalassus the second time, the track uncovered is different from before, but the concept is identical. at the end of the trail, thalassus will once again surface from the depths, and 'the guns' will throwkarambwanat the monster. upon eating the karambwan, thalassus will sick up and expel jones back onto the boat. on instruction, 'the guns' will make a break for land. note: there is a chance of looting an additional 3 items while hunting thalassus for the second time. back at the fishing guild, jones will reveal that he managed to snag atoothfrom the beast. head back tohemensterand deliver the tooth tolinza. return to the fishing guild one last time and talk to jones. quest complete. deadliest catch is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: deposit box north-west ofbedabin camp deposit box south ofelf camp deposit box west coast ofharmony island deposit box west coast ofmort myre swamp deposit box piscatoris - south offalconry deposit box north-east ofpollnivneach deposit box south coast ofape atoll deposit box south ofbrimhaven the concept art forthalassus the concept art forjones the fisherman the interface when at sea."

these items are tradeable), and bronze antiquities (by distressing bronze gear). the amount and the type of items vary for each player, which are stated in the quest journal. the bronze antiquities are made from oxidised bronze gear by distressing them. they will provide anempty craterequired for distressing. the possible amount and type of bronze antiquities are as follows: the bronze gear can be smithed, or purchased from shops or other players. the closest anvil is innardah, you can walk there, use ascroll teleport, use thedesert amulet 2or better variants or take the carpet fromsophanemtopollnivneachand then tonardah. bronze daggersandscimitarscan be bought fromblades by urbiinsophanemfor 1680 coins each. bronze platelegscan be bought fromlouie's armoured legs bazaarinal kharid. to get theugthanki dung, the player must have reached this point of the quest. to acquire it, the player must travel topollnivneach. the easiest way is to usepollnivneach teleport, however, themagic carpetnetwork is also a viable option. once there, enter the building exactly north-west of the well in the center of the town and speak toisma'il the kebab sellerand ask him to sell you a bottle of special kebab sauce (option 3). once you have thered hot saucein your inventory, head to the building directly south-west and proceed to the fenced area containing twojasim the camels. use thered hot sauceon the trough to the south. this will lead tojasim the cameleating the food and subsequently defecatingugthanki dung. the player may now use a bucket to pick it up. there are two ways to distress the bronze gear: once collected thesmelly crate, a pyramid top, and 10 gold artefacts, it must be given to simon templeton, who is near the agility pyramid. the gold artefacts must be unnoted. do not use the trade option, instead talk to simon and select the dialogue option ""some archaeologists asked me to deliver some artefacts to you."" he will give you anartefact receipt. return to the archaeologists' camp. abigail will give the player an emptyscabaras researchbook, and ask to collect 4scabarite notesand copy them into the book. these notes can be found as drops from: because the monsters that drop the scabarite notes are undead, thesalve amuletis effective here. it is possible to gain all four notes from killing a single type of monster. when at least four notes have been gathered, add them to the research book and talk to the archaeologist again. she will give you thescabarite keythat will unlock the door to the dungeon.
the emptyscabaras researchbook does not have to be in your backpack when copying the notes in. head directly north from the archaeologist's camp to enter thescabaras dungeon(the dungeon symbol furthest north) with the scabarite key in your backpack. enter the dungeon, and talk to theclay golemto learn about the puzzle that needs to be mastered. there are four rooms, each with a lever at the far end that needs to be pulled. there is a time limit within which all levers need to be pulled or you have to start again. the door mechanism is powered by a furnace to the north. you must first light the furnace with logs. three piles of logs can be found in astorage boxto the left of the furnace which may be above yourfiremakinglevel. it is recommended to bring your own logs in case of failure.protean logsdo work. lighting the furnace with logs requires a firemaking level 20 levels higher than just lighting the logs. see the table below for required levels. talk to the golem to assign power levels to the four rooms. depending on your skill set, set the power levels and race through the rooms. the settings and success chance in each room based on skill level and power level are tabulated below. with the minimum quest requirements, power levels should be in this order from the highest to the lowest: mysterious box room (thieving), narrow walkway room (agility), empty room (strength), scarab room (combat). after talking to the golem, add another log to the furnace to gain more time. the room with the narrow walkway requires the player to cross an oily pipe. assigning more power level to this room will make the pipe less oily and therefore easier to cross. agility potionsor asummer piecan help with crossing the pipe. after successfully crossing the pipe, pull the lever. the empty room requires the player to pull a huge lever. assigning more power level to this room will lighten the lever and therefore make it easier to pull by lowering the required strength level. strength potionswill help with pulling the lever. the room with the huge scarab requires the player to slay the level 92giant scarab. assigning more power level to this room will cause more damage to the scarab. equipping akerisand prayingdeflect/protect from meleeordeflect/protect from rangedfrom one of the two attacks is generally effective if the player has food. a halberd can also be used to melee the scarab from a distance in combination with protection from ranged so the player does not take much damage. an easy way to defend against the scarab's melee attacks is to stand outside the narrow door and uses deflect/protect from ranged. if a player dies during the fight, their gravestone will appear outside the dungeon entrance. players should consider killing the giant scarab last, as a failure in any other room after the scarab has been killed may require the player to repeat the entire puzzle, depleting more life and prayer points. after the scarab has been defeated, pull the lever to complete the room. the room with the mysterious box requires the player solve a puzzle of the mysterious mechanism. players need to reveal three runes of the same type on a 6×6 board. once three runes of the same type are revealed in a row, they remain visible. players can select and reveal up to three runes per turn. the objective is to reveal all the runes on the board. the right hand side shows a mechanism which contains: a cog, a pinion, and a switch. clicking on any of these during a puzzle will add or remove turns to the puzzle countdown counter. set higher power level or having a higher thieving level will make this puzzle easier to complete. since each puzzle assignment is random, a simple way to solve the puzzle is to prepare a piece of paper with a 6x6 grid and copy the runes as they are revealed. the players can also use the preferred way of typing in chat. use these notes to find triples. after pulling all the levers you will be allowed to enter the vault area. players wishing to restock supplies (food, prayer points, potions) can now do so without repeating the above puzzles, as the door into the vault area will remain open. the monsters in the vault area have a high chance ofpoisoningplayers, therefore some form ofantipoisonis recommended. even when under the protection of one of these potions, the ranging monsters can still hit with one 90 poison damage. additionally, using thethermal bathand disablingauto-retaliatewill help the player avoid taking large amounts of damage. enter the newly opened hallway. the first trap is two squares from the entrance door. search and deactivate it, then continue west. the cave will open to a larger area with multiple scabarites, continue west through the cave. there are traps in some passages near the northwest area. either disable them or find a way around them by approaching the area from the south. you should see a room with thehigh priest of scabaras. there is a fair chance of a player dying while in the vault area, even with 70+ combat stats and good armour. it is therefore highly recommended that a player brings high healing food (such asmonkfishorsharks) and anemergency teleport(such as theectophial) in case the player receives heavy damage. open the door and enter the room. all attacks will now cease. upon entering the room, thehigh priest of scabaraswill immediately talk to you, but you can safely turn off prayers, drink antipoison, etc. the order of commands with which you talk to him have little effect on progress; as long as you choose polite options and continue besting him in combat, he will eventually snap out of his trance. first, say: ""conversion, eh?"" he will say that you must either follow scabaras or die. now, you must make him angry. if you say his magic skills are bad (pathetic beetle-brained magics), he will attack with magic. if you say his ranged skills are bad (couldn't shoot an ogre from two paces), he will attack with ranged. same with melee (scabby battle skills are no match for mine). pick either magic or ranged. he will start attacking you. his combat level is 92. fight him, he is identical to his fellow scabarites in terms of combat. after you deplete his health he will immediately talk to you. leaving the room makes him immediately unaggressive, but also puts you back in the dangerous scabarite room. if you re-enter his room again, you must repeat ""conversion, eh?"" and once again provoke him and defeat him before continuing. this time, do not make him angry. ask ""by all the deities, what is going on here?"" then say ""sounds like the devourer dragged you into heresy for her own ends."" he will attack you with a different attack style; pray against him and once again wait until he talks to you again. when he talks, repeat ""by all the deities, what is going on here?"" and then say ""i sense the hand of the devourer in this. am i correct?"" however, this time, instead of attacking you, he will snap out of his insanity and assure you that the scabaras will no longer do any harm. teleport out once you are done talking with him. scarab swarms can appear in the room with the high priest. they have low defence and are very easy to kill withkeris. if you die in the room with the high priest it will be impossible to retrieve your possessions because the room is instanced. during the quest you collected four or morescabarite notes. to complete the achievementscabigail, optional to the quest, you will need to collect 19 notes to complete thescabaras researchand give them back to abigail. 17 can be obtained from killing monsters as you did during the quest, the last two are found in chests in the antechamber. return to the high priest in sophanem,

of chivalryis aquestthat replacedblack knights' fortress. it featuressir owenandsaradominand is the second quest to take place in thesixth age. this quest has references to the formerblack knights' fortressquest and therunescapenovels, in particularbetrayal at falador. speak tosir owenin the garden north of theedgeville monastery. he will tell you ""the owl hoots at midnight"". respond with any of the available options. sir owen will explain thatsir amik varzesent him to the area for a mission, but that his contact hasn't arrived yet. soon you are interrupted by a cutscene ofsaradominarriving to the area. after choosing an option (either kneeling to, standing before, speaking to or calling saradomin asnow imp), progress through the conversation. if you have openly declared allegiance to a god through agod emissary, you can bow before him if he is your chosen god, or if you have sided with any other emissary, initially defy his request and declare your loyalties to another god. saradomin will tell you that his enemies, thekinshra, have discovered a powerful weapon last used during thethird age. he needs you to prevent them from using it. accept the quest. since you will need a disguise to enter the fortress, take the armour just south-west of you, made up of the black knight captain'shelm,cuirass,gown,gauntletsandboots. equip the armour and return to saradomin. make sure not to have overrides active as it will prevent you from progressing in the quest.  saradomin will tell you that you'll be impersonatingcaptain dulcin, the overseer of the black knights. sir owen will accompany you as your prisoner. with your permission, saradomin will teleport you to the entrance of theblack knights' fortress. if you have a pet or familiar out, dismiss it before saradomin teleports you, or you will not be able to go through the portcullis in the next part of the quest, this will save you from the possibility of not being able to dismiss the pet or familiar after being teleported. during this section, you need to speak to the various characters in the fortress, convincing them that you are captain dulcin. wrong answers will increase your suspicion bar, which must stay below 100, or you'll be kicked out and have to start over again. attempt to open the portcullis and talk to thefortress guard. regardless of your answer to his first question, your suspicion bar will be raised to 25. the guard will ask you what you're doing with a knight of saradomin. before continuing, you may inspect the tapestries to learn about the lore of the quest, including thesiege of falador, thekinshra, and thewar of 164. speak tolieutenant yorkin the middle of the floor. he will ask you why the prisoner is not under guard. head north-west and speak to the fortress guard next to the staircase. he'll ask what you're doing and tell you prisoners aren't allowed on the upper levels. now on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us], head to the southern part of the building. speak tohierophant marius, who will try to give you the mark of zamorak. you may pray at thezamorak altarto the south, restoring yourprayer pointsand reducing your suspicion bar by 5. speak to another fortress guard at the south-east staircase, who again will tell you not to bring a prisoner up to the higher levels. next, speak tolieutenant gravesin the hallway, who will inform you that the witch has escaped and the operation has been sabotaged. lieutenant graves will ask to guardsir owen, but before he can do anything, owen will incapacitate him. search the body for 250coins. you're given a choice whether to kill graves or tie him up. pick either option and head to captain dulcin's quarters. search dulcin's desk in the north-eastern area to findcaptain dulcin's journal, which you're unable to unlock. head up the stairs to the ritual chamber. search the wardrobe for aletter from lord daquarius, search thebox of candlesfor threered candles, search the shelf forchalk, and then take thegrimoire. now read the grimoire to learn the ritual and gain 250magicexperience. to prepare for the ritual, repair the symbol on the floor and replace each of the three candles. light the candles by using them on the candlesticks positioned around the ritual circle, they are not specific to any particular stick so you may use them in any order. once you have the candles lit, talk to sir owen. he will tell you to chant over the north-west candle. when you start chanting, you can check the grimoire to find the right words for the candle, which varies for each player: #1 on the grimoire on the north-west candle, #2 on the north-east and #3 on the south-east. it must be in order. sir owen will confirm which candle needs to be chanted next. the correct order is: arom nahrea imperium feritas silenti sepulchrum igasac perdimit ebulam after chanting at the last candle, a portal will open up to an unknown realm. prepare for battle by using the convenient bank chest, and enter the portal, which contains enemies with stats scaled to your own levels. after the following point, if you need to bank for more supplies, you will need to teleport out. if you then talk to saradomin he will offer you a teleport back to the ritual chamber. the portal leads to a saradominist crypt, with threeblack knightstorturing adamsel. after a quick cutscene, dispatch the three black knights, which may require some food. search their bodies to find somecoinsand acage door key, which you can use to unlock the damsel's cage. she explains that she isdawn, a sister of theabbey of st. elspeth citharede. dawn will tell you that the black knights have found a weapon sealed behind a holy barrier, and they're trying to sacrifice her to breach the barrier. you're given a choice of what to do with her, but she'll stay in the main area regardless of your decision. search the supply crate for 100fire runesand 200water runes, and take thehandwritten messagefrom the crate in the south-east. enter the doorway to the east, to a crypt filled with the bodies of saradominist warriors from the third age. inspect the coffins or the heaps of bones for more information on the history of the area. open the portcullis to the south, gaining 125strengthexperience. head to the centre of the new room, looting the black knights' bodies for somecoins, and speak tofern, the ghost of a fallencentaur. her duty is to protectelora's wand, a powerful wand of her sister,elora the lifegiver. fern's duty is to judge the virtue of those who attempt to wield the wand. you'll have to defeat her in battle to take the wand from her. the fight against fern is fairly easy, however some food is recommended. she attacks with ranged and is weak to crushing attacks. like the previous fight, her stats are scaled to your own levels, and sir owen will provide a token amount of support. occasionally, she will use a special attack, where she charges at you with a powerful spell of energy. when she does this, flee until she stops, and then resume attacking her. once fern is killed, the first barrier to the wand in the south will be lowered. you'll have to solve a matching puzzle to lower the second barrier and access the wand. there are 16 total tiles surrounding the wand, which means eight pairs. click one tile and then another, and owen will tell you what they represent and if they match. you are allowed eight incorrect guesses. after eight incorrect guesses the puzzle will reset and you have to try again. the final barrier requires you or sir owen to sacrifice their virtuous blood. after a conversation with owen about whose blood to sacrifice, a cutscene will play. the final barrier will fall, and dawn will teleport in and steal the wand! head back to the main room and talk to dawn. after explaining her foul intentions, she will kill sir owen, and raise both him and theblack knightsfrom the dead before teleporting away. the zombified owen and knights will then attack you. as with the previous fights, their life points are scaled, although they are fairly easy. you can defeat them in any order you desire. one tactic is to stand on the stairs and use magic or ranged weapons as the zombies are unable to climb stairs. once they are defeated, search sir owen's body. you may compose a eulogy, say a prayer to the god of your choosing, and takehis shield. go north and open the portcullis, gaining 125 strength experience, and enter the main tomb area. talk to dawn and attack her. she will havelife pointsscaled to your combat level (up to 49500), and this is the hardest fight of the quest. dawn attacks using standardfire strikespells. she also has a special attack that creates a pulsating purple cloud that covers a 3x3 area and deals 10% of your maximum life points in damage every few ticks. when she's about to release the purple cloud, there will be a set of white pulsating circles where you're standing, and 2.5 seconds later, the purple cloud will appear. their duration depends on how far you've progressed in the battle. this can be avoided by running away from where you're standing. initially she will create one purple cloud, and during the duration of the purple cloud(s) will attack you with non-deflectable magic attacks. after you complete each skeleton wave, she will create an additional purple cloud in succession to the previous one (2 clouds after wave 1, 3 clouds after wave 2, and 4 purple clouds at once after wave 3). dawn has no weaknesses, but since she attacks with magic, ranged armour and weapons are beneficial. if you stand upon the platform while all possible purple clouds are not in effect, she will push you off the platform, then start summoning a purple cloud, but if all purple clouds are currently in effect, she will not push you off. thus, melee is only usable after baiting out all of her purple clouds. when the fight starts, hide behind a coffin and get ready to usecombustorfragmentation shot. leave your cover, use your ability, and quickly hide behind cover again. she is not able to attack you or summon a purple cloud if you are behind cover. a player should only have to worry about skeletons when using this method, but it will take significantly longer than the normal method. if you run to the stairs, she will not be able to hit you and you may stay there long enough to recover your health if you have enough patience. you can also simply hit her normally, run behind the coffin, come out on the other side of the coffin and hit her again. repeat this until she dies. in addition, there is an altar on the east side of the room which provides unlimited prayer restores, allowing a player to turn on powerful prayers permanently, such assoul splitandtorment/anguish. every time she loses 25% of her total life points, she will shroud herself in a barrier which blocks all attacks against her. she will then summonskeleton warriors,skeleton archers, andskeleton magesto attack you. while they are alive, you cannot harm dawn. she will summon four skeletons when she is at 75% health, five when she is at half health, and finally six at 25% health. as her health decreases, so does the spawning health of the skeletons. skeleton archers spawn with the warriors in the second set and mages spawn in the third set with the archers and warriors. the most efficient strategy is to take cover behind a coffin so dawn cannot attack you, allowing you to focus all your attacks onto the skeletons only. players who are low on health or wish to save food during the fight can hide behind a coffin andrestuntil their life points have regenerated. although this can take a few minutes, it is a viable option for players struggling to defeat dawn and her summoned skeletons. if you die, you will respawn in captain dulcin's office, and when using the portal, you will be immediately teleported back to the fight. if you teleport out of the fight to avoid death or for some other reason, you can either re-equip captain dulcin's armour to regain access to the fortress and proceed to the ritual chamber or speak to saradomin in the monastery to be teleported directly to the ritual chamber. when you leave, dawns' health will return and you'll have to fight through all the skeleton waves again. remember to use the bank chest near the ritual chamber to prepare for combat with dawn. using the portal transports you to a location near dawn where the fight can be renewed. when you defeat dawn, search her body to find thewand of resurrection,dawn's key, and theskull of remembrance. unlock the journal using the key and read it. it contains dulcin's diary entries, most notably on how he first entered the tomb of the fallen, lost many men to fern and failed to breach the final ward protecting the wand. the next entries are written in red by lensig, the witch to whom the letter you found earlier was addressed, and it is revealed she had been assigned to murder dulcin bylord daquariusbefore disguising herself as the captain. after looting her corpse, saradomin will call you back to the southern room. with these items, go back, and a short dialogue appears where saradomin demands you to give the wand to him. if you don't choose to give him the wand, he will grab it from you by force. if you attempt to use the wand on sir owen at this point before continuing the conversation, it will start an animation but fail and saradomin will explain why it didn't work, and furthermore that only a god can revive him a second time. the wand deems him unworthy when he attempts to resurrect sir owen, and thus brings the knight back, but it corrupts his arm at the same time. saradomin takes the wand from the player by force. saradomin uses the wand to revive sir owen. saradomin accidentally corrupts a part of sir owen. he explains that he wants to restore thecentaurrace using the wand, but that expedition must wait. although saradomin always uses the wand to attempt to resurrect sir owen, regardless of the player's decision, if the player initially trusts saradomin with the wand when he asks for it, and makes other certain dialogue choices, saradomin will entrust the wand to sir owen before the end of the quest, stating ""do not make me regret this"". the dialogue choices required for saradomin to entrust sir owen with the wand include very loyal saradominist statements. one example is when the player can choose to say ""i am still loyal to you, saradomin."" to which he replies his thanks, and mentions that the player's loyalty is appreciated in these ""dark times"", alternatively after completion of the quest the world wakes, using the fourth option will lead to saradomin entrusting the wand to sir owen as well. most conversational routes will, however, result in saradomin keeping the wand for himself, saying he wishes to wait and see how sir owen's corruption progresses before entrusting the wand to him, or speaks of how he may allow the player to use it in future. saradomin will teleport you back to the edgeville monastery with your permission, or you can stay and explore the area further. you will complete the quest either way.  unlocking and claiming all these additional rewards is a requirement for themaster quest cape. non-members/free-to-play: members/pay-to-play: members can find these rewards in the coffins in the tomb of the fallen, which can be returned to via the portal in the black knights' fortress or by selecting teleport as an option on the skull of remembrance which is given to you in the quest. the death of chivalry is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: concept art of the wand of resurrection. concept art of the puzzle room where the wand is contained. concept art of fern. concept artwork for captain dulcin's armour. artwork of the corrupted sir owen, with zamorak and saradomin overlooking in the distance. infiltrate the

however, these are put in order to make it faster: after you have spoken to the required people, you may ask zanik about the mark on her forehead. if she doesn't talk, teleport away and come back to her in the basement. she tells you about the origin of the 'mark' - she received it whilst collecting thetears of guthix, and that she is destined to do something great. after this, she will suggest going to theh.a.m. hideout. put on your set of h.a.m. robes and walk to theold mine entrance, which is found north-east of lumbridge, just south of thegod statueand west of thecowpen. once you are at the headquarters' entrance, you need to pick a lock on the trapdoor that leads to the dungeon. climb down the ladder and talk to a regularh.a.m. memberor guard. they will tell you that the leaders, sigmund and johanhus, are planning something big in order to get rid of the dorgeshuun, but they won't reveal the details to any regular members. one of the h.a.m. leaders,johanhus ulsbrecht, can be found in the southern room. talk to him about the cave goblins, but as the member informed you, johanhus doesn't want to share his ideas with you. wander around to the south of the main h.a.m. room, where zanik will spot a trapdoor behind a banner. right-click on the dirt tile, ""pick-lock"" the trapdoor — you need 23thieving— and go down. you will now be in a storeroom. in the following section, if any of the guards catch you, you will be sent to jail, which is located on the floor above. do not worry though; zanik will pick-lock the door to the jail, but you will have to kill the guards with zanik all over again. finally, when all the guards have been laid to rest, listen at the door. a few people are clearly having a conversation inside the large hall, although it is inaudible for your ears. zanik, however, has sharp hearing skills and she informs you that they are talking about some machine being planned to use for evil. as zanik tries to further explain, a senior guard catches both of you and throws you into jail. when you wake up, you find that zanik has not suffered the same fate as yours. talk tojimmy the chisel, who says thatsigmundhad taken zanik outside. right-click on the jail door and ""pick-lock"" it to escape. if you forget to talk to jimmy, simply talk to one of the members and exit the h.a.m. hideout. leave the h.a.m. hideout and you'll findzaniknear the entrance. you notice that although she isn't breathing, the strange mark on her forehead is glowing. pick up her body. whilezanikis dead, and in your inventory, home teleports can be made without her returning to the lumbridge castle cellar. if you've completedtears of guthix, you can use agames necklaceto teleport directly to thetears of guthix cavern. alternatively, if you have unblocked the opening from the lumbridge castle cellar to thelumbridge swamp caves, you can enter as you would if you were going to the dorgeshuun mines, but instead of going through the tunnels, head through that opening to the south and onwards to the tears of guthix cavern. after reaching the tears of guthix location, talk to juna. she will ask you to collect 20 tears (blue tears add to the count while green tears subtract from it), which can restore zanik to life. although a ""time left"" is displayed, there is no time limit. this does not count towards your weekly tears of guthix progress, and it gives you no experience. a cutscene will follow after you collect the tears, and zanik will explain what she had heard in the h.a.m. meeting room. johannus, sigmund, the h.a.m. deacon and a senior guard were talking about building a drilling machine at the lumbridge water wheel with help from dwarves, causing the swamp caves to flood with water from theriver lum. after the cutscene, home teleport to lumbridge and head to thelumbridge castlebasement using the trapdoor in the kitchen to get zanik to follow you again and then make your way to the lumbridge watermill. go across the bridge to the east bank of river lum and travel north until you find a cow pasture on one side of the road and a farm with chickens on the other. once you reach the farm, you see a trapdoor leading from the south side of the watermill. you must be wearing the full h.a.m. outfit for this to work - talk to thedwarfguarding the trapdoor and say you're there to help. unequip your main-hand and off-hand weapons and shields, and speak to zanik. search an empty crate south of the dwarf, and zanik suggests hiding herself in one of them whilst you carry it into thedungeon. you will automatically pick the crate. go down the trapdoor into the dungeon (if you leave the dungeon for any reason, you will have to talk to zanik and get her into the crate again). you can remove the h.a.m. robes and wear your armour now. critical:go west and walk up to sigmund, instead of immediately clicking to attack him. youmusttrigger the dialogue with sigmund in order to have zanik attack him, which is needed to complete the quest. with cinderbane gloves, you are able to poison sigmund without needing to use dialogue. he will die without ever switching to protect from ranged.  immediately following this scenario follow the step as if you killed sigmund the regular way. sigmund, who is level 42, will appear, along with three level 36guards. sigmund will use a protection prayer based on the attack you are using, so focus on his henchmen first. note that like for all npcs, sigmund's prayers do not run out and give him 100% protection. after sigmund's guards are dead, zanik will range him. he will switch to protect from ranged. attack him with melee, magic, or necromancy. at 10 life points, he will escape with a ring of life, but curses you and promises to strike back at your goblin friend. should you die or leave the area while fighting, zanik will remain there, waiting for you to return. however, all three guards will have re-spawned and sigmund will have regained his health. after clearing the area, smash the drilling machine to foil their plans. go down the southern tunnel and exit there, and you'll find yourself back with the dorgeshuun leaders, discussing whether the city should be opened for the ""surface-dwellers"". after hearing zanik's account, they welcome you into their city,dorgesh-kaan. congratulations, quest complete! death to the dorgeshuun is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

you can now finally claim the sword from the altar. head up the ladder and you will find a scroll from gideon to the north of the ladder, which tells you that he has managed to locate denath. the wizard is currently in the temple in south-east varrock, directly south ofaubury'srune shop. make your way to the temple and climb down the trap door just outside the entrance. you will meet gideon inside. when you climb down the ladder to the temple, if you have lost or destroyed silverlight, or mounted it in yourquest hall, gideon will give you another. you must now fight your way past somecultists. you must kill all of them in a room before the magical barrier to the next will disappear. if you stand close enough, gideon will attack them, and you will get the experience for the ones he kills. while passing the final barrier, a cutscene plays where you confrontdenathand a group of his cultists, with the demonology book placed on a strange zamorakian symbol. do not click anywhere else during this scene, or it would have to start again. he taunts gideon for not being able to stop him, before completing the ritual and teleporting away, leaving his cultists behind.delrithappears at the spot of the now-burned book, ready to spread chaos over the city. he attempts to attack you with a powerful blast, but due to gideon shielding you, it only succeeds in killing the cultists. you must now defeat delrith usingsilverlightordarklight: no other weapon will work against him, excluding off-hand weapons, which work as long as silverlight or darklight is equipped in the mainhand slot. every time it loses 250 life points, it shouts ""prepare to be incinerated!"" and launches a magical attack; gideon will then create a protective shield around him and tell you to come underneath the shield. if you do not do so, delrith's attack will reduce your life points to 1, otherwise you will be hit by 20% of your current life points and gideon will teleport somewhere else in the room. if you are wearing certainsaradominitems,royal dragonhide armouror fullarmadyl armour, you cannot hit delrith. if you run low on health during the fight and have no food, you may restore it by leaving and re-entering the arena. if you die and lose silverlight while fighting delrith, you may reclaim it from gideon bede in the catacombs. after killing delrith, the room will start to collapse, and gideon will teleport you both back to the saradomin church. speak to him one final time to finish the quest. congratulations, quest complete! demon slayer is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

of thetemple of ikovand thebrimhaven agility arena. when you ask him for a quest, he tells you that he works for the archaeological society of varrock and needs help in finding an ancient artefact.

and he will have translated the item and give you a journal in return, now take this journal back to the archaeologist who will ask if you want to read it or not, select the 'don't read' option and he will take the journal to read for himself for a few moments now. talk to him again and he will now ask for your help, while offering to split the treasure between himself and you, select the option to help him when prompted and he will now tell you to split up to search for clues. asgarnia requests your help in locating this wealth, and agrees to split the treasure evenly. he wants you to dig around for information down at thebandit camp, while he searches for clues amongst the bedabin nomads. if you wear an item aligned to saradomin or zamorak, the bandits in the camp will attack you, which can deter you from proceeding. even if you survive the onslaught, eblis will refuse to talk to you, calling you a false prophet. go to the western side of the bandit camp and buy abandit's brewfrom the bar. talk to the bartender again, asking him if he knows anything about the four 'diamonds'. shocked by an outsider's knowledge of the desert, he tells you that there is indeed an old tale about the fourdiamonds of azzanadra, but you'll have to speak to someone more invested in the desert's history to learn about them. speak toeblis, who can be found inside (or near) the eastern-most house, past the general store. ask him why the bandits are so hostile towards outsiders and request to learn more about their history. he explains that a few generations ago, theirgodwas banished and they were left to fend for themselves against the armies ofzamorakandsaradomin. they were attacked from all fronts and eventually lost their land, and were forced to take up home in the desert. their hero,azzanadra, was imprisoned and bound in a stone structure to the south of the camp, and they await for his return to cast vengeance upon those who stole what was theirs. ask him about the diamonds, and he'll tell you that they are the legacy left behind by azzanadra, stolen by the warriors of zamorak after he was imprisoned. you must subdue and kill these creatures - who have absorbed the power of the diamond into themselves - to retrieve them. eblis is ready to help you in your endeavour, in the hopes that azzanadra might be free again. he needs a few items from you to create special scrying glasses, using which he can sense the diamonds' power and provide a rough location of where each of them have been. use the required items on eblis and he'll tell you to meet him a short distance south-east, at the site of the bandit camp lodestone. head to the small hill to find eblis standing between sixmystical mirrors. look into each of the mirrors and you will see six locations acrossgielinor. two of them - the pyramid and the bandit camp - are not indicative of the diamonds' current location. the other four locations show where you can find the diamonds - these are,canifis, an icy location neartrollheim, asmokey wellnearpollnivneachand a calm, serene area with benches and trees that is west offishing guildand south ofbaxtorian falls. you must now obtain each of the four diamonds - namely the diamond of ice, blood, shadow and smoke - which are in the possession of strong guardians. this can be done in any order. avoid keeping any of the diamonds in your inventory for as long as possible, as there is a chance that you'll be attacked by a level 81stranger. though very easy to defeat, his special attack can deal upwards of 5000 damage;protect from meleewill significantly reduce damage from his attacks. he does not appear again if killed. travel tocanifisand enter thehair of the dogpub, where a cutscene ensues (if it doesn't play, just go ahead and talk to malak) wheremalak, a vampyre lord, demands a blood tithe from the tavern's owner. after some conversation, malak recognises you as a stranger and asks of your business in these lands. tell him that you are looking for theblood diamond, which piques his interest and he makes a proposal to you - he'll tell you the whereabouts of the diamond, but you must successfully kill its owner, who is currently another vampyre lord nameddessous. when you agree to his deal, he points you towards dessous' resting place, which is in the graveyard located south-east of canifis. malak also provides you with instructions on how to lure dessous out and kill him. you will first need to get asacrificial offering potfromruantun, a vampyre in thedraynor sewers. make sure to speak about the offering pot, otherwise you will have to go back to malak. head to thedraynor sewers, the entrances to which are located bydraynor jail, and north of the draynor marketplace. in the northern part of the sewers, talk to the vampyre namedruantunand exchange the silver bar for an offering pot. next, you need to bless the pot with holy power to weaken dessous. for this, you require the help of thehigh priestofentrana, so make sure you have banked all of your weapons and armour. head over to entrana (using awicked hoodto teleport to thelaw altaris the fastest way) and talk to the high priest, who happily obliges. if the pot is not blessed, you can still confront dessous, but you cannot kill him. return to canifis and speak to malak. he will damage you for 50 life points, and fill the blessed pot with your blood. crush the garlic to get somepowderand add it to the pot of blood, along with the spice (ardougne spice stallis a quick way to get both garlic and spice), to get ablessed pot (complete). the pot will still be named ""blessed pot"" but the examine text will be: ""a blessed silver pot filled with blood, garlic and spices."". the sacrificial pot is now ready to lure dessous out of his tomb. if you use the pot on dessous' tomb, but escaped without killing him, you need to fill the empty blessed pot with blood, crushed garlic and spices again. take the pot to thegraveyardsouth-east of canifis in themort myre swamp. if you do head through the swamp, beware of ghasts on the way as they may rot your food on your way to dessous, unless you are carrying a chargeddruid pouchor anouroboros pouch. however, since you only need to run past them, it would be unlikely for them to rot more than a couple pieces of your food; the graveyard itself is ghast-free. the maze-like swamp and the path in the area can be annoying. starting from outside canifis (on the outer side of the swamp moat, east of the bank), enlarge your minimap, then click the area immediately west of the hut with the agility icon (you should see two hunter icons), then click the south-eastern hunter icon. then, click the spot directly south of that icon, across the swamp lake - your character will need to take a long automatic detour to the southwest. when you get there, you can click on the graveyard on the minimap. once you arrive at the graveyard, prepare yourself for combat and pour the blood on the tomb to summondessous. after the fight, go back to malak and give him the blessed pot for the blood diamond. make sure to bank the blood diamond immediately in the canifis bank to prevent thestrangerfrom appearing and attacking you. this is by far the hardest part of the quest. the icy area in this part of the quest reduces every stat level by one every few seconds, while also dealing 200 life points of damage;adrenalineandrun energyare also periodically reduced by 10% (makingrejuvenateimpossible to use). you will not be able to run unless you use thesurefooted aura, have theendurancerelic power active, or have bathed in thesalt-water springinoo'glogbeforehand. using thesurgeability also considerably reduces time spent in the cold. bringing afamiliarwill makekamillose interest in you, and he'll stop fighting and walk away, before reappearing with full health. under these conditions, you will have to kill 5 level 89 enemies, withstand attacks from aggressive, high-levelice wolves, have a boss fight, and risk repeatedly falling on an ice path. however, you can make multiple trips before defeating the boss if necessary. travel totrollheimbytrollheim teleportor walk fromdeath plateauthroughtunnel to trollheimortroll stronghold. from there, head up the north-western-most of the forks north of trollheim, and onto a path leading towards theice path. at the end of this path, you'll find anice gateand atroll childcrying beside it. talk to the child and give him a cake. he calms down and tells you that his parents have been captured and frozen by a ""bad man"" because they ""stole"" his diamond, even though they had only merely found it lying around. promise the kid that you'll save his parents, but that you'll need the diamond in return. after he agrees, enter the ice gate and you'll notice a cave to the south-east, blocked by ice. to access the cave, you must remove five chunks of ice. this can be done by killing theice trollsnearby, and can be verified by the message: ""a chunk of ice falls away from the cave entrance..."" in your chat box. fire spellsdo considerably high damage to the ice trolls, and is thus recommended to use. as your stats are constantly falling in this environment, you must drink restore potions when your magic falls below the required level. alternatively, using the combat boost from agod bannercan give a refreshing +5 magic boost that completely counteracts the stat drain for 30 minutes. it is also advised toprotect from meleeagainst the trolls. once you have killed five trolls, the cave at the back will be unblocked. continue through the cave. if required, leave to restore your stats or restock on items. the area through the cave has level 95 wolves, so protect from melee is highly recommended. the path is long and winding, so running when you can is highly advised, as it will save time and prevent you from dying or temporarily losing many levels. at the end of the path, you'll face againstkamil, who is level 84 and has 21,000 life points. he is a lot more deadly than his combat level suggests due to his special attack, which has an effect similar toice barrage. after kamil has been defeated (and if he does not respawn), turn off all prayers and use food sparingly — there will be no more fighting for this diamond, so you will only have to worry about the constant 200 life point damage from the cold and the potential 200 life point damage from falling on the upcoming ice path. you may also use thesuper restore potionand twochocolate cakesthat he drops to get yourself back up. you may teleport out and heal after you've defeated kamil; you will not have to fight him again. once kamil is dead, follow the winding ice path around a small mountain. at the end of the path is an icy ledge; put on your spiked boots and start climbing up the ledge. you may frequently fall and take 200 damage. super restore potions may help here, since higher agility seems to decrease the fall frequency. however, with thesurefooted aurayou can run the whole course fall-free. theagility capewill also prevent you from falling. follow the path all the way to the top until you see another gate and a bridge. on the other side, the troll child's parents are encased in ice. run across the bridge and smash theice blocks, which are weak against fire spells (make sure to un-equip anynecromancyweapons while using fire spells, otherwise you may do no damage), to release thetroll motherandtroll father. if you are low on health, talking to the frozen trolls and keeping the dialogue open can temporarily stop the auto-damage and allow you to heal. after freeing the troll parents, they will take you back outside the gate and their son will give you theice diamond. teleport out and quickly bank the diamond. be sure to restore any fallen stats to regular levels before continuing the quest. head topollnivneachany way you like and go around the hill from the south side until you reach a well, the entrance to thesmoke dungeon. make sure you have afacemask, or some similar kind of face protection, equipped and climb down into the well (if you do not wear any protective headgear in the dungeon, you will be inflicted with 200 life point damage every 12 seconds until you are down to 10 life points). note: if you have completedsmoking kills, it is recommended to enter from the well that is insidepollnivneach. enter the dark stairs immediately to the west of where you drop down, and you will end up right next to a torch, allowing you to get to the chest quicker after lighting the torches. at the centre of the dungeon is a large cavern that houses a chest, which when attempted to open, says ""light the path to claim the key."" in each of the four corners of the dungeon are torches that you need to light to open the chest. however, each torch will only light up for 5 minutes before burning out. plan your route through the dungeon first, and then run and light all the torches, sipping energy potions or using a spirit terrorbird to restore run-energy. if you have access to the salt-water spring atoo'glog(afteras a first resortquest), it is strongly recommended to make use of it as you will be doing a lot of running during this part. you do not need any combat equipment yet, as you have a chance to restock before facing fareed. when all four torches are lit, run to the centre of the dungeon and open the burnt chest to obtain awarm key. if you walk, the first lamp will burn out by the time you reach the chest. once you have the key, restock and go back to fight fareed. with the warm key, stroll to the east part of the dungeon and use it on the gate to awakenfareed. fareed is level 84 and has 20,000 life points. if you die after entering fareed's lair, you will lose your key, although if fareed kills you or you leave the fight via the gate, you do not need to relight the torches or obtain another key. once you have killed fareed, thesmoke diamondwill automatically appear in your inventory or be dropped on the ground. teleport out and bank the diamond. travel west of thefishing guildto where there are severalmoss giants- just to the north of them, there is a fenced-in area nearbaxtorian falls, where you'll findrasolo. talk to him about a diamond and he will tell you about the location of the shadow diamond - in a dungeon which can only be accessed by the use of aring of visibility, and protected by a guardian nameddamis. he is willing to part with the ring of visibility, if you can retrieve hisgilded crossthat was stolen by laheeb, a member of thebandit camp. boosts will not work for this part; if you do not have at least level 53 thieving, you will receive the same failure message over and over. take some food, antipoisons and as many lockpicks or hair clips as you can carry, to the bandit camp. in the southern-most tent is a secure chest; there are three locks which you must get through, any of which will reset the lock on a failed attempt. click the confirmation and you will start picklocking the chest. repeat until you manage to open it and get a gilded cross. once you have the gilded cross, return to rasolo and exchange it for thering of visibility. if you lose the ring, rasolo can provide you with more. wear the ring and head a bit east to discover a ladder in the fenced picnic area. this is the entrance to theshadow dungeon. if you take off your ring of visibility at any time while in the cave, you will have to leave the cave and re-enter to fight damis. climb down the ladder and follow the directions shown by the shaded, yellow region in the map above to reach damis' lair. when you reach the centre of the large, eastern-most cavern,damiswill appear. note that it seems that he only appears if you approach the centre from the south-western entrance. if you enter from the south-west, but then run up the edge of the chamber without going to the centre, then going to the centre may not summon him. you must go back to the south-west entrance and go straight to the centre. damis is a level 84 enemy with 20,000 life points, and only uses melee to attack you. once damis is defeated, pick up the shadow diamond, teleport out and bank the diamond. return to eblis at the bandit camp lodestone with the four diamonds in your inventory. he explains that the zamorakian and saradominist siphoned azzanadra's life force and stored it in these diamonds, holding him in the stone structure to the south. by placing the diamonds in the pillars surrounding this structure, you can release the concealment spells and proceed to free azzanadra. go to thejaldraocht pyramidsouth-east of eblis, and place a diamond in each of the fourobelisksat the pyramid corners; each obelisk can absorb only a specific diamond. you should be able to determine the diamond from the appearance of the obelisk, but trial-and-error works too. the following table shows which diamond should be used on each obelisk. when all four obelisks are activated, the concealment spell breaks and the pyramid doors will unlock. climb up the stairs and enter the pyramid. the pyramid houses a lot of dangerous monsters, such as the level 86scarab swarmsoccasionally boiling out of the floor, and level 77 mummies roaming about and spontaneously popping out of sarcophagi. all monsters use melee and the scarab swarms can also poison you. the room containing the altar on level 4, however, is safe. the levels in the pyramid are numbered in the order that you encounter them in the quest. the shaded grey path marks the route. if azzanadra is not present in the room, use thealtarand he should appear. speak toazzanadra, who has lost track of time and believes that thegod warsare still going on, enquiring about the fate of the ancient civilisations likepaddewwa,lassarandannakarl. he is also surprised to notice that he cannot hearzarosin his mind any more. finally coming to peace with reality, he rewards you with theancient magicksof zaros, as gratitude for releasing him. desert treasure is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: you need to obtain aring of

ofkerapac's actions on theanachronianwildlife. players that have previously completed the kerapac track were given credit for completing this quest, even if the player skipped any of the curator's tasks by using task skip tokens or by completing the alternative task instead. due to this quest being a requirement forazzanadra's questresults indesperate timesanddesperate measuresno longer being optional forazzanadra's quest. this quest does not award anyquest points. the quest can be started by talking tothe curator, who is south ofburthorpe castle. he explains he has been tasked byserento investigate what effectskerapac's experiments withshadow animahad on the flora and fauna ofanachronia. as he considers local wildlife too dangerous to deal with himself, he seeks help and offers atome of trackingwhich points towards required specimens. there are a total of five tasks, each requiring four specimens. when each set of specimens is obtained a scene involving various characters occurs. after that return to the curator to receive another task. with each task the tome initially points to a specific part of the island. when the player is between 120 and 3tilesfrom the target location, interacting with the tome prompts a message with the number of tiles and direction in which to search.the next location is[number]paces[direction]. the tome seems to be directing you towards western anachronia. the first task involves finding flower specimens in the western part of anachronia. the scanning area can be accessed by traveling straight west from the anachronia lodestone across the bridge, then south-west towardbill (zygomite). after all four specimens are found, the player overhears a conversation betweenhannibusand his daughter,vindicta, concerning her visit toiaia, the homeworld of theilujankarace. vindicta expresses disappointment due to ilujanka largely accepting their race coming to an end. hannibus counters by mentioning the roleolun'daihas in their society, however vindicta responds that she felt compelled to intervene. she calms her worried father by explaining that she merely talked to those eager to hear her out and managed to convince some of the youngerilujanka pioneersto visit gielinor and see what life has to offer, and that their decision has also been influenced by a vision ofincoming calamityreceived by one of the soothsayers. hannibus expresses interest in training new a generation of dragon riders, and hopes that vindicta will be willing to learn more about their culture, to which she reluctantly agrees, providing they will prove themselves. the tome seems to be directing you towards the anachronia base camp. after finding each specimen, return to burthorpe and 'talk to the curator'.  choose 'talk about desperate creatures.', then 'talk about your progress.'  you are told that the specimens will be of great help and that the curator has another task for you. speak with the curator again and you will be assigned the next batch of specimens to gather. the second task involves shrubbery specimens near thebase camp. after all four are found, a conversation withmr mordautoccurs regarding the aftermath of kerapac's actions. mordaut expresses relief they are not under thedinosaurattack anymore. however, he notes damage to the camp from the volcanic eruption caused byelder godfulwhen she destroyedkerapac's laboratory. mordaut mentions that while some tents were flattened, most of the structure proved to be resistant to the erupting magma. not wanting to dwell on the past, he becomes excited about the prospect of finally doing properarchaeologyexcavations of theorthen dig siteruins. he notes there are still preparations to be done first, but the work should begin soon. he expresses interest in the recent discovery of two moredragonkingroups,nodonandaughraand is eager to find out more. the tome seems to be directing you towards south-eastern anachronia. the third task involves the island's fungi in the south-eastern part of anachronia. the scanning area is near themoksha ritual sitewhich be accessed by starting theanachronia agility coursefrom the south-west corner of theanachronia base campor using theorthen teleportation device. after all four specimens are found,zarosis encountered, waiting for something tooccurin the area. when inquired whether he spends a lot of time waiting, he explains that he has spent longer time waiting than the human race has existed, although he cannot blame mortals for rushing due to their short lifespans. he recounts his origin as a creation ofmah, along his sisterseren, and that they were treated merely as playthings by the elder god, with no awareness or care for their thoughts. zaros explains that his patience allowed him to eventually learn and escape mah's grasp. he cryptically states that he will not have to wait much longer for what he needs and hands the player the final mushroom specimen, leaving them wondering whether that was what the tome actually pointed towards. the tome seems to be directing you towards eastern anachronia. the fourth task involves finding insect specimens in the eastern part of the island. the scanning area is near the easternmostovergrown idolwhich can be access by starting theanachronia agility coursefrom the north-west corner of theanachronia base camp. after all four are collected, a conversation betweencharosandthokis overheard. the enchanter ridicules thok for trying to courtlaniakeawith a bouquet ofliverworts, which he considered an appropriate gift for aslayer master, thinking it would prove thok's appreciation for her combat skills. amused, charos recounts his attempt to woo a noble couple by getting them to plan each other's assassination, which got out of hand and forced him to lay low. thok wonders whether offering dinosaur fangs to prove his own skills would be a better idea, but charos suggests giving her space, reassuring that nobody else will sweep her off her feet as they are terrified of her, only to become annoyed when thok takes his words literally. he acknowledges some women may appreciate being wooed by combat, but implores thok to always ask first. he jokingly expresses interest in improving thok's love life, but notes not being good enough with necromancy to do so. charos notes he needs to check the integrity of his wards following encounters with kerapac, but gets annoyed again when thok keeps rambling about romantic gifts and starts musing about poisoning his tiresome companion. the tome seems to be directing you towards central anachronia. the final task involves frog specimens near thespirit grovein the central part of anachronia.  the quickest way to get there is to take the boss portal to the rex matriarchs and run west to use the teleportation device. otherwise, start theanachronia agility coursefrom the north-west corner of theanachronia base campand follow the directions to therex matriarchslair. after all four frogs are found, a conversation withprehistoric potteringtonoccurs. she explains that she is collecting fruit for thefarmbut politely notes she is too busy to keep the player company. she is confused by the player's disappointment, to which they explain they expected to eavesdrop on some important conversation or hear an ominous foreshadowing. she assures that she is there only to check on the fruit, which in turn confuses the player, but she remarks that it's not their interest and requests privacy. the tome seems to be directing you back to the curator in burthorpe. after finishing all tasks, the curator directs the player to speak withserenwho is addressing thecouncilon the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]ofburthorpe castle. after studying the curator's research, she explains to the council that whilekerapac's device, meant to poison all life with shadow anima, has been stopped, it had been operational for a prolonged period of time and the released amount will impact the growth of plants, likely resulting in a poor harvest and famine. she promises to help with the elves' resources, to which other members of the council, heavily affected by seren's loyalty aura, eagerly respond with their own promises of aid. seren asks to speak with the player in private. she expresses concern with the council's state, although she notes it may be beneficial in times of hunger. she notes, however, that there is a graver issue she has not yet revealed to the others. seren explains that while kerapac's plan to poison the eggs of the elder gods failed, the release of shadow anima has roused them and that another disruption of that power, however unlikely to happen, could finally wake them. seren directs the player back to the curator for rewards. he has been asked by seren to provide some manuscripts that might be helpful and rewards the player withcolossi & the time of colossiandreldo's ages seventeenth edition. congratulations, quest complete! desperate creatures is

to thecouncil of burthorpe, north of theburthorpe lodestone. talk toserenon the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]ofburthorpe castle. she will tell you to go to theanachronia base campand speak withmr mordaut. speak to mr mordaut and he will tell you thatcharosandthokare north of the camp. go to the north of the anachronia base camp, and down the two flights of stairs to the dragonkin gate. do not begin the agility course. talk to thok and play through his saga killing the dinosaurs and walking down the path towards anachronia base camp. once finished, talk to charos. excavate at thedragonkin remainssouth of charos and thok to obtain thedamaged dragonkin device. repair this at anarchaeologist's workbench(there's one up a couple flights of stairs just east of theanachronia lodestone) using 50orthenglassto obtain thedragonkin device, and bring it back to charos. after showing charos the dragonkin device, someorthen rubblewill appear to the north of him. excavate at this spot to obtain thedamaged dragonkin tablet. repair this at an archaeologist's workbench using 50 orthenglass to obtain thedragonkin tabletand bring it back to charos. location of charos and thok. the first location to excavate. the second location to excavate. next, you will need to show these two devices tohannibuswho is next toprehistoric potteringtonon theanachronia dinosaur farm. to get there quickly, go to the top floor of themanor farminardougneand teleport using themystical tree. hannibus will translate the tablet and tell you to meet him in the ruins in the north-east ofanachronia. see the picture for more information. to reach the ruins, use the agility course north of the base camp until you pass through the cave entrance and cross the roots. afterwards, head north-east to reach the opening near theferal dinosaursand continue east towards the ruins. you can see the path on the minimap by following the light brown-coloured path to the ruins. once you have arrived, hannibus will inform you that the ruins are home to another type of dragonkin; thenodon. as opposed to thedactyl, who wished to rid themselves of their curse bonding them to thestone of jas, and thenecrosyrtes, who went insane and attacked false users, the nodon believed that they could sleep through the curse. at his suggestion, use thedragonkin deviceon the door beside him. once you've entered, speak to hannibus again. you are in a sleep chamber where the nodon are hibernating. hannibus will mention that some of them are dreaming, but it is a shared dream and he is able to transport you into their dream if you agree. once hannibus puts you into the dream, speak to him to begin the nodon caretaker's memory. two nodon caretakers will appear. speak to hannibus again. he will suggest that you pay close attention to what the two dragonkin do. one will exit to the north. again, speak to hannibus. he will tell you to follow the first dragonkin who leaves the room. exit through the door to the south, and follow the nodon caretaker. he will lead you to the door on the north side of the ruins side of the ruins and access the lower chamber using the password ""hepencaraun"". you can enter the same door using the same phrase, then leave again. return to hannibus and re-enter the dream. this time, you'll watch the second dragonkin enter a code on the pylon in the south-east corner of the room. inspect the pylon after the dragonkin disappears and your character will remember the correct symbol when you need to enter it. you may also watch the dragonkin inside first and follow the other one outside after if you desire; the order doesn't matter. once you've done both, speak to hannibus to leave the dream. back in the real world, interact with the dragonkin pylon. cycle all three symbols individually until your character says that it looks correct and cutscene plays. you may need to zoom in to see the three symbols. if you are stuck in a loop with hannibus telling you to cycle the symbols, make sure you have cycled three different symbols, one on the right, one on the left, and one in the middle. then speak to hannibus but do not re-enter the dream. you are able to enter the lower chamber on the north side with the correct symbols now. exit the room with hannibus and run outside to the north side of the building. once inside, talk tohannibusand enter the next dream - the kindra council memory. go up the path to the east and talk to hannibus to start the memory. the kindra council meeting will start, with the four factions speaking; thedactyl,syrtes,nodon, andaughra. continue through the memory until the council dissolves. the dactyl, syrtes, and aughra will disappear. the two nodon will not disappear and they will then take note of you and hannibus, believing thatkerapacsent the two of you into the dream. after telling them that kerapac is attempting to destroygielinor, they will share a vision with the two of you, showing that kerapac'sshadow animaexperiments had displeased theelder godsand led to them binding the dragonkin to thestone of jasin retribution. for some players, starting this cutscene will crash the game client and make progressing the quest impossible. a workaround is to play in runescape mobile. try upgrading graphic drivers, or change from compatibility mode to normal on startup of game client or vice versa. you and hannibus will soon return to the real world, withcharosandthokgreeting you. kerapac will appear soon after, realising what you are up to. hannibus attempts to plead with him, but charos and thok will attack. after you fight him for a while, kerapac will explain that because of his control over the needle, he can manipulate all attacks inflicted towards him to deal nothing. although he states that he could easily kill you all, he decides not to out of pity, and advises you spend your final moments wisely. hannibus will suggest an evacuation through theworld gate, but charos states that they wouldn't get everyone out in time. after some discussion, it's decided that you need more information. you each set out to learn more, and agree to meet at base camp when you've finished. go toburthorpeand speak toserento inform her of kerapac's agenda. you will then inform the council that kerapac has made himself invulnerable, but seren suggests that you speak toprimrose, as she wasthe needle's former guardian. go to primrose in her house to the west of thepiscatoris fishing colony. she will reveal that the needle seems to have a mind of its own, and that it has power over its guardians, not the other way around. ask primrose aboutgailand what is it like being her. then ask about the needle and exhaust all chat options. while she is unable to offer any solutions, the information she provides does have promise. you wonder if there might be a way to turn kerapac's connection with the needle against him. you decide to speak to seren and the rest of the council to see if they can think of a way to do that.  return to burthorpe castle and speak to seren again. she will reluctantly conclude that it is necessary to consult the needle's creator,jas, in the hopes of learning how to use the artefact against kerapac. she instructs you to meet her outside theheart of gielinorwhere she will request an audience with jas, and emphasises that you must be on your best behaviour when meeting with the most powerful being in existence. kerapac unveils his plan. jas lays waste to orthen. the dragonkin are bound to the stone of jas. meet withserenat the entrance to theheart of gielinor. she reveals thatjashas agreed to grant you an audience, and reminds you how important it is not to offend her. go through all the dialogue options with jas, picking options that are neutral or positive. jas will explain that she and her sisters already know ofkerapac's plot, but cannot intervene directly because kerapac'sshadow animadevice is a toxic barrier to them. she points out that she and the others can stop kerapac, but doing so would completely destroy the island and nearby settlements. seeing that you are willing to help, she will give you theeye of jasto stop kerapac and advises you to hurry before she and the others are forced to act. choosing three negative dialogue options will cause jas to state that she has reached her verdict, and that all mortal life will end. you will then be teleported back to seren and a dialogue box will open stating that you remember an alternative universe in which jas tears your body apart. if this happens, speak to seren to retry your conversation with jas and continue the quest. after you receive the eye of jas, end the dialogue by choosing ""leave"", and you will be teleported back to the entrance to the heart of gielinor. speak to seren, who compliments you on your handling of the meeting, and urges you to hurry back to anachronia to meet with your allies there. return toanachroniaand speak tocharos, who is now by thelodestone. you will show him the eye of jas, which he doesn't know how to use, but he has discovered some information about security that should prove helpful. while you're speaking, hannibus feels a tremendous amount of pain of fear, and kerapac appears. he announces that he has whipped the dinosaurs into a frenzy and is sending them to raze the base camp, but that he is mercifully giving you time to evacuate. talk tothokwith both of your hands empty, and he will provide you with his stick. most of the inhabitants are evacuated, but the archaeologists were too busy excavating and must now be defended. charos asks whether you want him to target either strong dinosaurs, weak dinosaurs, enemies furthest away from them, or enemies closest to them. choose ""closest"". then hannibus will ask where you want him. move him one square to continue the dialogue, though you should move him back to his original position when you get the chance. as the dialogue continues,laniakea, who has come to join the fight, states that she will target the furthest dinosaurs. thok will target the strongest, leaving hannibus to target the weakest. it's best to leave them with these settings, though you can right click on them to set them manually if you want to. you can also move each member of your party, but it's not necessary. once you're ready, begin the battle by pressing ""start"". there will be five waves of dinosaurs to fight off. you needn't do anything - it will all happen automatically. thok's attacks deal heavy damage,hannibuscan stop oncoming dinosaurs with his mind control, charos will use fire spells, and laniakea will use her spear in melee range and throw vials of poison at enemies out of melee range. as you are holding thok's stick, you will automatically attack nearby dinosaurs. the remaining archaeologists will be huddled on top of the lodestone, and may take some damage during the fight. as long as they don't lose all their health before the end of the fifth wave, you will succeed. if a wave is failed, the entire run must be redone again. if you lose twice, talking to thok will give a option to start an easier mode where all of you and your allies' attacks deal extra damage. next, speak withcharos, then speak to him again where he was at the beginning of the quest, north-west of northern start of the agility course. he'll instruct you to investigate the cosmic power surrounding kerapac's hiding place. if you don't havethe measurewith you, he will provide it to you, revealing that he ""borrowed"" it. you will have to find him four times in the ruins surrounding the volcano, and use the measure nearby him each time to progress. if he does not react when you place the measure, log out or hop worlds. he will note that he observed nothing strange when he was alone, but that the readings began to fluctuate once you got close. the locations of charos and where you have to place the measure is given in the image on the right. the order that you visit the last three locations doesn't matter. please note that on some occurrences, placing the measure will not trigger the chat. if this happens, re-placing the measure, re-logging, or hopping worlds should allow the chat trigger to occur. return to where you first metcharosandthok, where an entrance has appeared. as it is powered byshadow anima, you are the only one who can enter, as the others would be ripped to shreds if they tried to go through. charos notes thatguthix's blessing that turned your character into theworld guardianessentially grafted shadow anima onto your very soul, making you powerful and helping you resist forces that regular mortals cannot. he notes that you ""should not exist, but you do"". the lab security is controlled by four pylons. each quadrant of the lab is given a name inkerapac's tablet, which can be found on a lectern in the south-west room. each quadrant of the lab also corresponds to an elder god's name that unlocks the pylon. symbols on the walls of each room will tell you which room you are in; you can figure out which one is which by looking at how many characters are in the name, and whether the first and last letter are the same or different. for instance, kalistrak is nine characters and begins and ends with the same letter. once you figure out the name of each room, you now know which elder god name unlocks each pylon. to figure out which symbols you need to input, start cross referencing the letters of the names with the symbols spelling out the names of each room. you can also infer which room is which by reading their descriptions in the tablet, such as chenrath having a gurney and kalistrak being kerapac's personal quarters. once the correct combination is entered into the pylon, you will get a message ""the symbols snap into place and the pylon becomes inactive."" the solutions for disabling the lab security are below. the pillar symbols start on ""1"", so you won't need to move the middle symbol for any of the four pillars. after all four pylons have been deactivated, a cutscene will play and you can enter the northern part of the laboratory wherekerapachas ablack stone dragonfor security. it is level 91 and possesses 180,000life points. the dragon's attacks are the same as the one encountered in thedragonkin laboratory, but it is nowhere near as strong, nor does it summonblack hands—nevertheless, take your best combat equipment and food. at 140,000 and 100,000 life points the dragon will land on the centre of the arena and generate a flame spiral, with all incoming damage being greatly reduced. as with the original encounter, dragonfire protection is unnecessary. if you leave the area to gear up, don't forget to bring theeye of jasto enter the laboratory again. once you enter the arena, a barrier prevents you from leaving, and you are prevented from teleporting out. the dragon doesn't attack you immediately when you enter unless you move close to it, so you can simply log out. after defeating the black stone dragon, kerapac will appear, frustrated by your resistance, claiming that he is trying to save all of the worlds at a cost of only one. as you cannot convince him, you will use the eye of jas to allowjasto intervene, claiming control ofthe needleand of kerapac and his hibernatingnodon. kerapac begs to be killed, but jas denies him. kerapac encourages you to leave as the laboratory begins to collapse. the player has a minute and 48 seconds to escape the laboratory. run to the eastern area where three large rocks will collapse and entrap the player. fortunately, the death of the black stone dragon has allowed your allies to enter.charosandthokwill help you escape the laboratory by destroying fallen rock piles whilehannibusguides you to a side area. rocks repeatedly falling in front of you will impede your movement, so do not expect to move far—click close to your character to move more consistently. if you fail to escape within the given time, you will restart at the entrance to the black stone dragon pit; if you had a familiar summoned, it may disappear. after failing twice, you are given an option to retry with more time. once you leave the laboratory, a cutscene will play wherefulemerges from the volcano, destroying it along withkerapac's laboratory. as with the prior cutscene from earlier in the game, this cutscene can again crash the game client for some players; however, unlike the prior cutscene, upon logging back into the game, the player will rejoin the quest at the aftermath of the cutscene and can continue on through the remainder of the quest normally, albeit missing the information that the cutscene provided. speak to any of the three to continue the quest. have an open inventory slot so charos can give you thecosmic focusdevice. charos will then tell you to informserenthat kerapac has been stopped. return to seren inburthorpe; you may inform her thatguthixhad imbued you with dangerousshadow anima, or keep silent. if informed, she will reassure you that if something happens, she and the others will be prepared. for now, she advises the player to celebrate their victory. quest complete!  kerapac and charos escape the laboratory. the anachronia volcano erupts. ful emerges from the volcano. desperate measures is directly required for the following

the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]ofburthorpe castle. she will invite you to joinher counciland explain her cause, stating that theelder godssee life on gielinor as food for their unhatched children. she plans to appeal to the elder gods and show them that life is worthwhile, as she was taught to see life as worthwhile. the first elder god she seeks to impress isbik, with the plan being to build a garden. she tasks the player with negotiating a location, task force and seed collection from the assorted council members. for the location, speak to eitherzaradorto use thefeldip hunting grounds,vanescula drakanto use the swamps ofmorytania, orosmanto use the northern desert. for the workforce, talk to eithermoiato summon an undead force,brundt the chieftainto use thefremennik, orsir amik varzeto use thewhite knights. for the seed supplier, talk to eitherazzanadra,garlandia, orking roald. once a combination has been selected, confirm your choice. the council will reject the suggestion however for varying reasons, such as the fremennik being unsuited to the proposed environments and vanescula viewing the white knights as an invading force. if you logout or exit to lobby, the combination selected will be reset. after three failed combinations,kerapacwill appear and claim that seren's plan of appeasement will fail and was proposed out of sentiment. he proposes an alternate plan, to use theelder artefactsto put the elder gods into a permanent sleep. the council will all agree with kerapac, except for seren.thokwill insist on joining, believing himself able to scare off the elder gods. kerapac gives in, and instructs you and thok to travel tothe needle, west of thepiscatoris fishing colony. thephoenix lair teleport scrolltakes you fairly close. alternatively, fairy ring codeakqcan be used to reach the fairy ring just south of the colony orhome teleportto theeagles' peak lodestoneand take the row boat withkathy corkat. head tothe needleand talk to kerapac. he will say there is a power resonating from the artefact and ask if you can feel it. pick any option. kerapac will say he can charge the needle, but this will causetemporal

final two can be found on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]of the farmhouse. once all five are closed, return to kerapac. he will remark that, while the elder artefacts are not truly sentient, they have something resembling a consciousness, and that the mind of the needle has refused him. he will state that he needs assistance from a powerful human mage,charos, whose magic has affected the minds of others in the past. head tocharos' tomblocated undermcgrubor's wood. the fastest way to get there is byhome teleportto theseers' village lodestoneor viafairy ringalsand head into mcgrubor's wood. you will find the hole for charos' tomb just south of the house. once in the tomb, investigate the coffin to get aletter from charos, in which charos has written that he is aware of what you are attempting and is eager to meet you. he challenges you to play one more game in order to find him: you must locate three keys hidden in three locations, each of which are alluded to by a riddle within the letter. these keys will empower hisold necklace, turning it into thenecklace of charosand allowing you to remove his disguise once you find him. if you have previously destroyed the necklace, you can get another fromuri(if you've added the trinkets) in the grave undermcgrubor's woodor from may'sstorage chestif unlocked. caution:if you log out or enter the lobby while in a puzzle room, it will reset the current puzzle! the first location is at thevarrock dig site, near the entrance tothe empty throne room. a group of threearchaeologistsand anexaminercan be heard talking nearby. astrange portalcan be found outside the entrance bycelia diggory). step into the portal, which will lead you to a room with a sliding puzzle in the centre and several smaller rooms containing chests located around the perimeter. (the tiles that make up the slider puzzle will not budge until at least one chest has been unlocked.) in order to solve the sliding puzzle and obtain the key, the doors leading to rooms with chests must be unlocked by stepping on the coloured magic portals on the floor. the colour of each portal corresponds to specific doors opening, however no particular combination of portals is required so it is simplest just to try each colour of portal until the door to the room you wish to unlock has opened. once a room containing a chest has been unlocked, the chest within must be unlocked by completing a riddle. solving the riddle properly will allow you to obtain a four-letter code which must be entered into the combination lock interface in order to successfully unlock the chest. the exit portal will not appear until the puzzle is solved, but it is still possible to leave by teleporting out. the following table outlines the possible riddles a player may be required to solve in order to unlock a chest: if not, the code is the first letter of each ingredient in the recipe, in the order of their appearance on the list (e.g. 1,052 grams offlour, 102 grams ofchocolate dust, 56 grams ofdoogle leaves, 2eggs =fcde). once the chest is unlocked, it will reveal part of a word grid, which is the solution to the sliding puzzle. unlock all of the chests to obtain the completed word grid and solve the slider puzzle. each word is a description of the tile it represents, located within a three-by-three grid. in order to complete the slider puzzle, each tile on the ground must be located in the same position that corresponds with its location in the word grid with the camera facing north. the puzzle is solved just as one would solve atreasure trails puzzle boxordungeoneering sliding tile puzzle. if done successfully, the room will shake and you will obtain a key, which will automatically combine with the necklace as you receive it, and a magic portal leading outside will appear. if the player leaves the room before the puzzle is solved, then progress is reset and the puzzle will need to be solved again for a new solution. if you need help solving this puzzle, try using a sliding block puzzle solver found online. the other two locations are: solve both slider puzzle rooms as before in order to obtain the remaining two keys. after obtaining the third key, you will get a bloody clue scroll with ""urit"" written repeatedly across it, the same as the one found duringyou are it, and reading only the letters that are different spells out ""reldo"". the player then mentions that they think they should head to thevarrock palace library. return to thevarrock palaceand speak withreldoin the library. opt to use the newly-empowered necklace andcharoswill reveal himself to you, explaining that reldo was merely a well-placed disguise.kerapacandthokwill join you and discuss plans on what to do with the needle. kerapac will commission charos with creating a device of his own design, with which he hopes to interact with the needle. thok will disapprove of this approach, stating that they can cow the gods into submission instead. charos suggests thok go do that and thok will leave. charos will request threerune bars, tworunite stone spirits, 10mind runes, and 10gleaming energyin order to build kerapac's device. get these items and give them to charos: he will build his device, then instruct you to meet him at the needle. this section contains voiceovers in the background that do not include captions. it is strongly recommended that you turn on your audio so that you do not miss them. charos prepares to use his device on the needle. before he can, however,gailappears and attacks him and thok. kerapac will send you into the needle while he fends off gail's attempts to stop them. you will end up in the deepest part ofguthix's cave. as you wander around the cave,sliskewill attack. defeat him five times and collect thebroken mask shards. sliske spawning seems to be triggered by stepping in specific areas; make sure to explore thoroughly to make them all spawn. once sliske has been defeated and five shards obtained, reassemblesliske's maskand wear it. you will imagine yourself as sliske at the time he assassinated guthix. while picking up the fragments, it is revealed that guthix was aware of sliske and told him his own death was necessary to continue his ultimate plan to create the world guardian to protect the world from the gods. after collecting all shards, combine them and wear the completed sliske's mask. head to the end of the cave, whereguthixis, and click on him to trigger the original guthix assassination cutscene fromthe world wakes. leaving sliske's body, you will be transported tonaragunnext. find and harvest five memories relating toseren,armadyl,zamorak,bandos, andsaradomin. an image of the mortal guthix will appear by the fairy ring (where a replica of the god guthix's petrified corpse is also located) and ask that you talk to him. after talking with him, you will be transported back to his cave. in the cave, redirect the flow fromgailto theavatar of kerapacby switching each of themutable animaonce. there are four switches in total, two on the top, two on the bottom. if done correctly, the light orbs will cross paths twice, once on the upper level and once on the lower level. after this, you will appear in a facsimile of theempyrean citadel.sliskewill appear in the middle platform and begin talking about gods, presumably intended towardsjas. head to the west into the room withgielinorand use the agility shortcuts to make your way around the room. the beginning of the agility shortcut is outside of the south-east corner of the room with the smoke bombs. interact with the window there that looks like a white fish. make your way over the planks down the cliff and up to the fish window on the south-west side and climb inside. climb through the obstacle near the storage crates. you can now exit the door to the north. you will go through all the rooms you did during themissing, presumed deathquest, but with either kerapac or sliske appearing and talking about their plans. making it to the end and jumping down will instead bring the player to a new area. the player will be brought to the upper platforms ofsliske's labyrinth, where anima will now also entertemporal rifts, which the player may enter as well to go to a different area of the room. changing all the redirect anima to go to the avatar of kerapac will advance the quest. there are four mutable anima to switch: one on the ground level, two on the middle level, and one on the top level. the final room appears as the end area of thedragonkin laboratory, althoughsome nodeswill be coloured orange and frozen in place. to unfreeze these, players must find memory wisps (one in the room to the north-east, one in the room to the south-east whereverak littlewould appear, on the stairs to the west leading to where theblack stone dragonwould appear), and listen to kerapac talk to his sonvicendithasabout his plan to return to a place calledorthen. once all energy is redirected to kerapac instead of gail, a cutscene will occur. see the image for a map of the area and the direction the animas should point in. the cutscene shows kerapac gaining control over the needle by stabbing it with thestaff of armadyl(with charos' device allowing kerapac to retain his memories), reverting gail into her human formprimrose. using his newfound power over the elder artefact, he teleports it away and flies off towards the east, out past the ocean to prepare for the next stage of his plan. talk again to charos, who is furious at being backstabbed, and primrose, who must go see her mother. return to burthorpe and let the council know what happened. seren will be told that kerapac had set up the world guardian, and that using the needle's power, kerapac seems to have a plan that involves the sacrifice of one planet -gielinor- in order to destroy the elder gods and save all the other planets permanently. seeing as the council was betrayed, and that a third party's plan is in effect to destroy all life on the planet, seren begins to formulate how to stop and kill kerapac with the aid of the council and charos. congratulations, quest complete! desperate times is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: desktop background fromrunescape's splash page tablet background from runescape's splash page mobile background from runescape's splash page collaged from images on the desktop version of runescape's splash page collaged from images on the tablet version of runescape's splash page collaged from images on the mobile version of runescape's splash page concept art of charos concept art of kerapac more concept art of kerapac concept art of thok"

attack of the bandits! at this sundial location, another gnomon will appear, but this time you and ozan are stuck in quicksand. exhaust all the options trying to escape, none will work. you are transported into a small cavern and momentarily stunned, while a critter scurries away with the diamond. inside the cavern is the sundial ofcrondis. ozan complains about his injured leg and sends you off to search the tunnels in solitude. enter any tunnel, and you re-emerge in the room with ozan. after a few rounds of ozan joshing about this, it becomes apparent ozan is sitting on the sundial gnomon. once again, inspect the sundial (crondis having a crocodile head) and follow the sunbeam. in the tunnel ozan once again complains about his injured leg, so you are unable to run. at the end of the tunnel you arrive in a pitch-black room. eventually ozan discovers a torch, revealing that the room is infested with dung kalphites. you must recover the diamond from the dung the kalphites are rolling around by left clicking them. ozan will aid in slicing open dung kalphites also. if you don't have a suitable weapon, there's abronze scimitarspawn in the room. after you have sliced a few of the wrong kalphites, ozan starts shouting whenever he sees one which is sparkling. you can also turn on ambient sounds and turn off music in settings and listen for a tinkering noise. you'll find asapphire, anemerald, aruby, and then the diamond itself. picking up the diamond may put you back on the surface above the quicksand, you must go back down to continue the quest. the diamond cannot be picked up using the loot all option and must be picked up by right clicking it with no other loot on the ground, meaning you must clear all loot from the ground nearby first before attempting to pick up the diamond. a hole will appear in the ceiling through whichleelawill talk to you and ozan, aiding your escape from the cavern. navigate the discussion between leela and ozan, then point the sundial towards the insect. follow the sun beam for the final time towards ""the lion's mouth"": the ruins of the temple of amascut. once here, speak tolady kelito initiate a cutscene. lady keli demands the diamond. if you refuse, lady keli becomes increasingly belligerent, threatening to kill all present if they do not comply. whether you say yes or no, the diamond inveighs against its surrender through keli's guards, though you are eventually swayed into delivering it to her. lady keli protests at being called crazy and reveals she isamascut. before departing, she sets her guards on you, ozan, and leela. apep hasdamage capof 50. apep may yell out ""whirling dervish!"". if you do not run away from him during this attack, you are briefly stunned and knocked back. avoiding this attack can be made easier by placing the escape ability on your action bar. heru may blind you with his shield, but is otherwise a fairly simple fight. certain forms of passive damage, such as the effect of theblood amulet of fury, will ignore the damage cap. the devourer! amascut creates a sandstorm amascut leaves via tornado once both guards are defeated, click on prince ali to rescue him and initiate another conversation. you will be returned to the palace at the end of it with the prince and leela, and ozan goes off to recover the diamond. osman and leela will argue over osman's methods, resulting in leela renouncing him and storming off. somewhere in the desert,ambassador jabariplots withamascutas the former reveals he poisoned the emir, and amascut tells him to return to the pharaoh as she still has business here. osman says leela would come around and compliment your capabilities. you need at least 2 free inventory spaces for the reward. congratulations, quest complete!

if you have forgotten the information, they are as follows: if it is done right, you will receive alevel 1 certificateand atrowelas a reward. return to each of the students and ask them for level 2 answers, which are as follows: once again, talk to the examiner for the test and after passing it, you will receive alevel 2 certificateand arock pick. speak to the three students again and obtain the answers for level 3 certificate. however, katarina (in a purple top) will want anuncut/cut opalfor her help this time. pan in the river for one, if you did not receive it when you were looking for the special cup. it is also possible to receive a cut opal from excavating level 1 grids. now go back to the exam centre. answer the questions correctly and you will earn the finallevel 3 certificate, along with aspecimen brushandjar. you can now dig anywhere you wish; you can also show all the 3 certificates to seth minas and choose between something to drink (fruit blast) or something to eat (chocolate cake), as a reward. you now need to use thetrowelto dig into the soil at the level 3 grid, which can be found on the east side, near student 3. click on the soil until you find anancient talisman. this can take multiple attempts. any other items can be discarded. take the talisman to terry balando in the exam centre. he will be impressed by it and say that it's a talisman of the godzaros. he will give you aninvitation letter, which must be shown to workers to get permission to go down the private winches. make your way to the northern-eastern digging area of the dig site (directly north of dig site level 3) and you will see a winch near the top of it. use the invitation letter on thedig site winch operatornext to it. afterwards, attach a rope to the winch in order to gain access to the sub-levels of the dig site. grab anarcenia rootnear the west wall while you're there as you'll need it later. walk east and search the brick blocking the path to the south; it is currently impossible to pass through until the bricks are cleared. return to the surface and head to the other winch, located to the west. once again, use your rope and go down the winch. speak todoug deepingand inquire on how to move a large pile of rocks. there are also twoarcenia rootspawns in this area, against the western wall and north-western corner. he suggests blowing the bricks up, and also speaks of a former colleague who had discovered some chemical substances to use for that process. however, he was scared by his findings and left them inside the other shaft. he also gives you achest key. use the 'drop trick' for multiple keys if you want to obtain more compounds after completing the quest. make your way to the bigger dungeon down the north-eastern winch. after the quest you will not be able to get more ammonium nitrate sincedoug deepingwill not give you another key, so be sure to get a lot of it if you want morechemical compounds. you do not need to keep getting a key from doug, you can just keep clicking on the chest whilst it's open. now search the brick to the south and use the chemical compound on it, and immediately after that, search it again and use the tinderbox option to blow it up; you will automatically run away. enter the central chamber. pick up the stone tablet in the centre of the zarosian sign and go back toterry balando. then, show the stone tablet to him to finish the quest. the dig site is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

if you have fully completed all 5 subquests and the quest ""dimension of disaster"", you will have received the following: dimension of disaster is not currently required for any quests or miniquests. the dimension of disaster is a dimension where theplayernever existed, thus the world of gielinor went through a quite different timeline. as the player never existed, they never inspiredjackto become a righteous person. instead, jack became a malevolent and powerful sorcerer who terrorized the inhabitants of gielinor.guthixfinally felt that he couldn't stand by any more and killed jack to end his reign of terror. whenserendiscovered that guthix had killed a mortal, she was horrified and thus rejected guthix's offer to come to gielinor and remained ontarddiadwith herelves. slightly embittered by seren's refusal, guthix went to sleep at the end of the first age. without seren's light to subconsciously guide him,zarosnever arrived ongielinor, and as zaros never came; the hydra-godloarnabwas free to terrorise its surroundings. loarnab increased in power, gained intelligence, discovered demonic magic and used it to build an empire around itself, essentially following the footsteps of the zarosian empire; thedesert pantheonwere endangered by loarnab's forces, resulting in icthlarin summoning themahjarratto his aid, only for them to betray him. similarly to the current dimension,nexwas made, but not from aviansies, icyene, vampyres and demons - rather, this nex was made fromdragons, virii, mahjarrat and hydras. while the extent of loarnab's power was unknown, it was eventually killed byzamorak, who used thestaff of armadyl. zamorak's rise to power started the god wars, which raged for centuries, until guthix awoke. guthix, however, due to his embitterment, was not as forgiving and directly attacked the warring gods - zamorak,saradomin,armadylandbandos, siphoning off a great deal of their power and energy, scattering it across the world before banishing them. guthix then returned to sleep, not to be heard from again. however, bandos managed to maintain a presence in gielinor, having discovered and possessedzanikas his chosen commander. the chosen commander eventually defeated the other warring factions by seizing all pieces of thegodsword, reforging it and using it against them. in her victory, she opened the doors to theancient prison, revealing nex, who instantly killed bandos' avatar. during the last years of thefifth agetheplayercompleted variousqueststo ensure the safety of the kingdoms ofmisthalinandasgarnia, but without their existence the kingdoms' history became another. guthix was neverassassinated, so the gods never returned to gielinor and thesixth agenever began. without the player's assistance in finding the heir to theshield of arrav,zemouregalconquered varrock, killing almost all of its inhabitants, reviving them as zombies. he also killed anyherowho dared to oppose him. tolna's riftwas never cleansed, thus allowing the horrors oftolnato infest and corrupt most of the misthalin underground. thekinshragained control overfaladorand exiled thewhite knights. thetrollswere eventually able to overrun theburthorpe imperial guardand went on a rampage in bothburthorpeandtaverley.count draynoreventually regained his strength, and he turned most of the population ofdraynor villageintovampyres.amascut's plans went on unhindered, and she was able to conquer thedesertand all its inhabitants, having her minions patrol the city ofal kharid. as several of themahjarratinteracted with the player in some way, they too were also affected in this dimension.azzanadrawas never freed from his prison,jhallanremained hidden,akthanakoswas eventually captured,wahisietelwas sacrificed in the 18th ritual,kharshaiattempted to attack new varrock with thefremennikbut failed andenakhradisappeared into the desert, shortly after akthankos' capture after rejectingzemouregal's romantic advances.lucienmanaged to acquire thestaff of armadylandstone of jasbefore destroying thetemple knightsandcrux eqal, but during the 18th ritual of rejuvenation, he attempted to use the artefacts, but was slain by the dragonkin, this time led bykerapac. after lucien's demise,sliskeattempted to find the artefacts for his own gain.hazeelwas revived by his cult, with the assistance ofphilipe carnillean, who had become snobbish as the player had never opened the world of adventuring to him. hazeel later managed to recaptureardougneand became king ofkandarin."

whether or not the quests have been completed. additionally, reading the threerunescapenovels (betrayal at falador,return to canifis, andlegacy of blood) may help the player understand the background ofjerrodthe werewolf. players can begin the quest by talking tomoiain theempyrean citadel. use theinvitation boxobtained duringmissing, presumed deathto teleport to the citadel, where you will find moia standing nearby. moia will give the player a quest fromzamorak, as well as acommunication devicewhich can be used to contact moia or to teleport tozamorak's hideoutbeneathdaemonheim. after talking to moia, you will be pulled into theshadow realmby sliske. he will ask what your plan is with zamorak's quest before sending you back to the normal realm. if you happen to log out or disconnect at all, any progress you've made in the quest will be kept. teleport to zamorak's hideout by accessing the communication device to meet withzamorak,bilrach, and moia (if you don't talk to zamorak first, some of the followers will not be in their locations). they ask the player to gather some of zamorak's most powerful followers to help with the heist;hazeel,nomad,general khazard,lord daquarius,zemouregal, andenakhra. you can search the chest to the west to receive5,000 coins, 250 dungeoneering tokens, and either 3 cut sapphires or emeralds (noted). depending on your skill levels, the other chests can be open and searched. the order in which you locate these chosen ones does not matter. zemouregal and enakhra can be found atzemouregal's fortress. the best route to get here is to teleport to moia atzamorak's hideoutvia moia'scommunication device. speak to her and she will teleport you to the basement inside the fortress. once there, you will have to kill severalarmoured zombies, then go up the stairs (if you leave at this point after killing the zombies, they will not respawn) and talk with zemouregal and enakhra; they will agree to join the team. there is currently a glitch that keeps you from using the stairs if you have lootshare on or are in a group. if this happens, leave your group, come back to the castle, and kill the armoured zombies again. after they teleport away to take their place at zamorak's side, you can search the chest in the room for5,000 coins, 3 cut emeralds (noted), and 250 dungeoneering tokens. in the event of your death your grave will be near the stairs by the rewards trader in daemonheim; use yourring of kinshipto return to your grave. hazeel can be found in his cultist hideout south of theardougne zooand east of theclock tower, enter the cave, and take the raft to the hideout and speak with hazeel. he will agree to join zamorak's team if the player will free a werewolf being held in a mansion ineast ardougne. go to thehandelmort mansionjust to the west of the marketplace and enter the trapdoor at the back of the mansion. speak withjerrod, who will tell you why he is being held as a prisoner and after a discussion will ask you to search the dead butler by the ladder for acell keyso you can release him. once you do, he will agree to join the team and will remark that he doesn't eat his associates. you can search the chest by the dead butler to receive5,000 coins, 3 cut sapphires (noted), and 250 dungeoneering tokens. nomad can be found indeath's officejust north of the draynor lodestone. upon entering the office, you will join a conversation with death who is attempting to reap nomad's soul in recompense for all the souls that nomad stole. he will agree to let nomad go because he owes the player a favour for rescuing him during the events ofmissing, presumed death. khazard can be found in theruins of uzerby entering the stairs near the clay golem. before he will join the team, he asks the player to search the shadow realm for his mother,palkeera, who he believes fought there alongside his father. agree to enter the shadow realm and search the body of palkeera to the north for abloody journal. read the journal and you will return to the normal realm when you close it. talk to khazard and he will leave for daemonheim. you can search the chest by general khazard for5,000 coins, 3 cut sapphires (noted), and 250 dungeoneering tokens. daquarius can be found in theblack knights' baseintaverley dungeon. speak with daquarius, who will ask you to help him discover who is behind the spread of ""saradominist drivel"", and a suspected assassination attempt. search the chest in the north-western room to find abottle of poison. go to the north-eastern room and speak with any of the black knights there. finally, ""discuss"" the issue with thepreaching black knighteast of lord daquarius in the centre of the room (either choice will work). bring the poison back to daquarius, who, after remarking that he knows who is behind it and that he will be taken care of, agrees to join the team. you can search the chest in the south-western room with lord daquarius for5,000 coins, 3 cut emeralds (noted), and 250 dungeoneering tokens. once all parties have agreed to join the team,moiawill contact the player and offer them a teleport back to the hideout. upon arrival, you are joined by general khazard, hazeel, jerrod, nomad, lord daquarius, enakhra, zemouregal, moia, bilrach, and of course, zamorak. at this point you may continue the quest or talk with people. once you continue, a discussion will start and zamorak will offer everyone places by his side after he has the stone of jas. shortly into the conversation, moia will report thatviggorahas arrived; zamorak will ask khazard to open a window to the shadow realm so that everyone may see viggora; he will appear and reports of a secret lair containing the stone of jas, hidden near the barrows in the shadow realm, but is heavily guarded. zemouregal and nomad insist they should be the one to retrieve the stone, but zamorak interrupts and demands everyone to follow his orders. he begins to outline his plan: the player and jerrod will infiltrate the perimeter and dispatch the guards, daquarius is to read the runes and unlock the vault, enakhra and nomad are to deal with sliske's magical traps, khazard and hazeel are to deal with sliske's mastery of the shadow realm, and zemouregal is to deal with sliske's undead horde. after zamorak tells you of his plan, moia tells everyone to meet south of the barrows in morytania at sliske's lair. while still in zamorak's hideout, you can search the chest by the western door for5,000 coins, 3 sapphires (noted), and 250 dungeoneering tokens, if you haven't yet. the entrance tosliske's lairis located just south-east of the barrows; you may reach it by running from northern morytania, or alternatively usedrakan's medallionto teleport directly to barrows and then walk a short distance south-east to reach the portal. just before you enter, you can search the chest to the north for5,000 coins, 3 cut rubies (noted), and 250 dungeoneering tokens. you must dismiss your follower before entering. upon entering, there will be a series of passageways with markings above the cave openings or on the floor. in every passageway will be a signpost with a poem written on it, giving the clues to which cave openings to enter. if you are uncertain of the colour, shape or number; right click and examine. from the first room, the cave openings are as follows: if you log out during the maze or the dialogue following you will be returned outside and will have to repeat the maze. once you have made it through the tunnels, you and jerrod must take care of the guards in a sorceress's garden-esque puzzle. you will enter the next room after a short discussion and must use the given movement options to sneak past the guards and traps to clear the room. you cannot run in these rooms. additionally, jerrod is needed for each section. in the event that jerrod does not follow you nor appear for you in the next sections, simply log out and log back in. any previous progress will be saved. wait for the guard to face away from you and forward dive past him to assassinate him. then wait for the masks to come on 3 times. you then have time to pass the beams, get to the dead spot in the centre of the room, and pull the lever on the south wall. after you pull the lever, jerrod will kill the second guard and you will have a second lever on the far west wall. wait for beam to flash 3 times, then once again you have time to get by the beam and pull the lever, which will deactivate the masks and open the next room. the first hallway on your right has a dark cloud which will send you to the room entrance. forward dive up the hallway following the cloud to the first doorway (there are also niches in the walls you can hide in). assassinate the guard as he walks past and pull the lever, jerrod will then kill the next guard. follow jerrod and forward dive past the guard and assassinate him (or you can assassinate him at the corner). proceed up the hallway past the last two masks to the lever and enter the next room. switches and guards will have numbers mentioned that correspond to the map image on the right. mask flashes do not pause in this room. this part of the quest is a little tricky, as it requires some degree of attention. you are required to multitask and keep track of various elements in a short amount of time. while you are not timed, some events will timeout. the order in which you complete these events does not matter, but be mindful to keep a steady pace and be aware of which steps were recently completed. upon entering the vault, you are greeted by two of sliske's masks, shadow and light. after a short conversation with them, moia will have you use jerrod to find the guards in order to view their memories of unlocking the door. speak with jerrod to switch to his view and use the controls to find sets of tracks (they glow green) by turning, then following the tracks to find the guard. you must then talk to moia to read the guard's mind. locate the correct memory by either listening to a light tinging sound or by looking at the speed of the blinking/pulsating area on the memory map. the memory meter does not have to be filled all the way up for it to count. half-way also counts as a memory. players have 3 attempts at getting a correct memory, but there is no penalty for failure. after you unlock the first memory, nomad and enakhra will begin draining the door. in the centre of the door is a black-and-white meter. nomad will increase the gauge he is working on while enakhra will decrease it. you must keep it balanced, requiring you to switch enakhra and nomad periodically. if the gauge goes out of balance, the room will reset and all previous memories will be lost. once the gauge is balanced, quickly switch to jerrod and track the next set of footprints. once jerrod tracks the footprints, drain the guard's memory via moia's ability. after the second memory is found, zemouregal will place portals to defend the room from the undead horde. you must also tell zemouregal where to place portals to keep the room safe. if any wights get into the room then it will reset. you can see where they will come from next by looking for glowing eyes in the tunnels. when you directly face the vault door, you're looking south. this will be confusing when allocating zemouregal's portals. keep a keen eye on your compass and on the compass in the top right of the portal menu. be sure to hit accept when you're done changing the portals. in your chatbox you will get a warning telling you zemouregal will move the portals in 60 seconds. if you do not change them in time, or change them incorrectly, the room will reset to the beginning. zemouregal will move these portals at the end of those 60 seconds, at which point you'll receive another warning and need to change the portals again. you can determine if the new portals location are correct by talking to zemouregal again after clicking confirm. you will get a message if they are already correct. to obtain the remaining memories, you need to use jerrod to track the wights down, then have moia drain their memories. you will still need to keep the gauge balanced and prevent the undead horde from entering the room. once all 5 memories are found, the doors will automatically open, and there will no longer be a need to keep balance. if you die during the fight, your grave will appear near the entrance to sliske's lair by the barrows. if you happen to have the drakan's medallion kept upon death, simply teleport with it to the barrows to quickly reach your grave. the type of combat method that is used does not matter; magic or ranged is preferred, however. players should also try to remain close to the shadow version of themselves, since the shadow has the ability to darken the room, which will cause massive damages to the player. in this part of the quest, the player encounters a level 84shadow of themselves. the foreshadow's life points and damage scales to your level. the shadow attacks mainly with magic, and has four special attacks that it will use throughout the first half of the battle. the first attack binds the player in webbing and deals rapid hits of 660 damage (at around level 90+ constitution), similar to one ofaraxxor'sattacks; it can be countered by rapidly clicking to break free. the second attack teleports the player to thestone of jas, after which the shadow casts a spell and shadow clouds roll down the stairways; if either the spell or the clouds hit you, you'll be dealt damage equal to 50% of your maximum life points. the player should run off the plateau and out of the way of the stairways. the third attack will darken the room and deal rapid hits of 825 damage to the player, unless you stay within melee range of the shadow. the last attack does not procure a text box like the others; the shadow will pull you in front of him, briefly stunning you and disabling protection prayer and deflection curses for 4.8 seconds. you will be unable to move or attack for a couple of seconds. once the foreshadow reaches 40% of its health, it will transform into the inner demon; move out of the way to avoid taking upwards of 2500 damage. the inner demon's attack speed will increase, and it will periodically summon dark portals which will heal him rapidly if they're not destroyed. it will not use any special attacks other than the room darkening one. it is highly recommended that you use protect from melee in this part of the fight, although if you attack from too far away, it will start attacking with magic. after you have killed your shadow, your view switches to the real realm, where a massive battle rages between your team and sliske's wights. during this time, you will be playing as nomad, whose role is to kill 30elite wightsthat are attacking teammates while they fight their shadow counterparts. nomad will be outfitted with three special attacks, any of which will instantly kill multiple elite wights close to him. once you have killed 30 wights, you will appear back in the shadow realm before the stone of jas. touch the stone to view a cutscene of the end of the god wars with armadyl, saradomin, and bandos standing before a defeated zamorak with the stone of jas. after the cutscene, you return to the real realm once again. as your character, you must kill the last 8 shadow members of the group, each of which starts with 250,000 life points. some of the apparitions will be at low health, due to their previous encounters with their true selves. additionally, some of the apparitions will target you. however, you need not worry about the incoming attacks as you will be able to channel power from the stone of jas and are able to hit very high with very good accuracy, as much as 25,000 damage per hit. if the apparitions die by an attack of another, they will regain their health in full. after defeating the shadows with the power from the stone of jas, nomad reveals his true colours and tries to steal the stone of jas or at least a piece of it. players can either choose to ruin his plans by throwing his spear back at him, or simply dodge the spear and let him enact his plot. either way, after some more dialogue, a cutscene will start, in which zamorak will teleport into the chamber and knock nomad to the ground, who teleports away before zamorak is able to kill him. allowing nomad to escape with the piece of the stone will make his soul blast attack duringnomad's elegydeal 9000 damage instead of 7500. zamorak will then touch the stone of jas, gaining power. sliske will then appear, and cast dark magic on everyone in the room apart from you and zamorak, freezing them in place. the cutscene ends, and after some more dialogue, you are given a choice between 3 options: if you choose to help zamorak, both you and zamorak cast a spell at sliske, injuring him, and he teleports away to the shadow realm with the stone to 'lick his wounds'. zamorak then congratulates you and the rest of the team for the work you have done for him, saying how he, and you, have gotten a lot stronger. if you choose to help sliske, you cast a spell at zamorak, and then sliske teleports both you and the stone to the shadow realm, where he congratulates you on making the correct decision. if you choose to remain neutral, zamorak alone casts a spell at sliske, injuring him, and he teleports away with the stone into the shadow realm to 'lick his wounds'. although zamorak is happy with the results, he is disappointed that the player did not help him defeat sliske. he will congratulate you and the rest of the team for the work you have done for him, saying how he and you have gotten a lot stronger. congratulations, quest complete! there are four chests withinzamorak's hideout, three of which contain an experience lamp which can be used on any skill. to go to the hideout use thecommunication device. the chests do not require elite skills (e.g. invention) to open. the fourth chest in zamorak's hideout and five other chests contain5,000 coins, 250 dungeoneering tokens, and 3 noted cut gems (either sapphires, emeralds or rubies): looting all these chests, excluding the jerrod chest, is a requirement for themaster quest cape. dishonour

this story is about how she once played in the great forests that once existed in the kharidian empire, and how a group of monkeys saved her from a jackal. monkeys during this time were both friendly and revered creatures. however, now it appears that since the lands of her empire have turned to desert, the monkeys have died out. she asks for your help in returning the ""sacred monkeys"" to the land. she suggests that this is connected to the goddessapmekenand directs players tojexand thesphinx, both insophanem, to learn all there is to know about apmeken, which will illuminate the importance of the desert monkey. go tosophanem, ideally by using thepharaoh's sceptreto teleport tojalsavrah. alternatives to this method include using the magic carpets fromshantay passto get there viapollnivneachor teleporting tomenaphosand running directly east from thelodestonethrough the gate by the guards into sophanem. talk tojexand thesphinxabout the minor gods and ask about apmeken; it does not matter who is talked to first. make sure you have any kind of cat or kitten following you before talking to the sphinx. go back to thepharaoh queen, e.g., by using fairy ring codedlqand running east. she says that although apmeken is the humblest god, allowing her monkeys to die was a great affront to her honour. people should not be surprised that the desert is a cruel, harsh and unfriendly place when they have turned their back on the goddess of friendship. she asks players to reintroduce monkeys to the desert, not as pets, but as free creatures. with the required items, head toape atolland speak to any of thethree wise monkeysinthe temple of marimbo. after some conversation with the monkeys, admit to them that you are really human. they will ask for proof, meaning that you will have to lead themonkey guardaway from the three monkeys in order to safely show them your true form. to make it easiest, be wearing your monkeyspeak amulet and have no items in your hands so when you equip the greegree, you still have an empty inventory (nothing to unequip). if you used a portable fairy ring, equip it in your pocket slot to keep an inventory space free. luring the guard is best done withnothingin your inventory but thegreen bananas. take some green bananas from the crate named pile of bananas in the north-east corner of the temple.  bind one to your hotbar, as this will allow you to insta-drop it with a keypress, leaving your mouse free to move your character. lay a trail starting at the monkey and ending at the crate by dropping bananas on the ground. avoid the gorillas, as they will eat any bananas within their reach. because of the gorilla at the north end of the temple, the trail will have to go around the entire building. the banana trail must be placed quickly, as the bananas disappear after a short time; and also, because the monkey guard returns to its post if the trail ends before the banana crate. when laying the trail, keep in mind that the guard cannot see around corners, and that the guard will not pick up any banana that rests atop the trap door in the east of the temple. the trap door itself counts as a corner; so make sure to place a banana between it and the ladder, lest your guard become stuck. there should be no more than 2 empty spaces between bananas in any cardinal direction, or 2 empty spaces in any diagonal direction. it is recommended to have as many bananas in your inventory as possible, since it is easy to run out before reaching the crate if you place them inefficiently. after successfully luring the guard to the crate, talk to the three wise monkeys again. after you remove your greegree to show them that you really are human, they urge you to quickly put it back on before you are discovered. they will then test your knowledge of apmeken by asking you a couple of questions about her. respond that apmeken has a baboon head when she is in a comical mood. next, tell them that the only place the squirrel could sit that the monkey couldn't was ""on the monkey's shoulder"". after you have gotten the three wise monkeys to trust you, talk toking awowogei, who is in a building south of the temple. convince him to start a colony. make sure that you do not mention apmeken to him or you will be imprisoned. he will immediately take up the idea but insist on building one inkaramja. persuade him that the desert would be a wiser option by telling him of the deliciousness and popularity ofchoc-ices. (there is no penalty for choosing the other options, and you'll just be booted back to the previous list of options after a short dialogue.) the king will get excited and commission choc-ices in the shape of a monkey (chimp ices). before leaving ape atoll, it is recommended that you buy amonkeyspeak amulet mouldfor 10 coins fromhamab'scrafting emporiumdirectly west of the temple, as it is needed to make the chimp ice. it won't be consumed, so feel free to use one from your bank if you have one. make your way tonardah. when you are ready to start the delivery, you will talk withrokuh, the owner ofrok's chocs box. talk to him about making a ""special choc-ice"" in the shape of a monkey, and he'll tell you that he needs a mould to make one. allow him to borrow the monkeyspeak amulet mould, and he'll agree to make you one for 1,000coins. you can buy more later from him for the same price. he'll eagerly hand over achimp ice, but he'll warn you that because of its irregular shape, the magic used to keep the treat frozen is seeping out. to keep the chimp ice from melting, you'll have to periodically cast one of the ancient magicks ice spells on it (see the table below for more information). in order to freeze the treat, left-click on the chimp ice (the ""freeze""-option) to open an interface in the chatbox, then select an ice spell. as long as this interface is opened the ice will not melt. you will be warned with a red message in your chatbox (similar to the messages warning you about dragonfire protection) of the status of your chimp ice. the ""freeze"" options are as follows: due to the volatile nature of the magic holding the chimp ice together, you are restricted to routes other than teleportation, commercial gnome gliders, spirit trees or grand tree pods. in order to get to ape atoll, you will have to speak withdaero,waydar, andlumdo(three gnomes from themonkey madnessquest). daero can be found in the south-east corner on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]of thegrand tree. various routes can be used to get from nardah to thetree gnome stronghold, some good options are listed below. the timer on your chimp ice will not advance when using a bank, the world map, transportation such as carpets and eagles, and when talking to npcs. if you run out of run energy, you can rest and pull up the world map without the ice melting. an easy way to quickly freeze your chimp ice is to assign a slot on youraction barto the chimp ice. doing this will mean that you can quickly bring up the display to use a spell on it. once you reach ape atoll there is a ""chocpoint"", so if your chimp ice melts you may start again by returning to lumdo at the south-east corner of the island. allowing yourself to be captured and locked up will get you a lot closer to the king; freezing the chimp ice one last time before escaping should get you there with enough time. this route requires having unlocked theballoon transport systemto the tree gnome stronghold, which requires the completion ofenlightened journey. the route must be unlocked from entrana, using 3magic logsper attempt, after which each use of the route will cost 1 magic logs. this route requires having completed theeagles' peakquest for use of theeagle transport system. you also require 45 strength to push a boulder aside to fully enter the cave. the king will eat the chimp ice and enjoy it so much that he grants you permission to set up the desert colony and supplies abarrel of monkeysto populate it. talk again to the wise monkeys in the temple. when you ask where they want to go, they tell you to take them ""between the camels humps"". they jump into the barrel, and you can head out. the location for the newmonkey colonyis the camel hump-like mountain in the kharidian desert, southwest of thedesert mining campas shown in the map to the right. the easiest way to get there is via the bandit camp lodestone. after you release the monkeys, themonkey colonistsandunarmed monkey guardswill make a camp of sorts and the wise monkeys will sit on some convenient rocks. talk to the wise monkeys, and they will demand you to set up a carpet route, as no one will come if there is no carpet route. go to al kharid and with yourring of charos (a)equipped, talk toali morrisaneto the north of the lodestone. ask him about starting a new carpet route, but he says he isn't interested since he has lost money trying to start new routes in the past. with a bit of persuasion, he will tell you that he was trying to set up a route to the pyramid north ofmenaphos, but when transporting a carpet it got caught in a sandstorm. his cousinalex the bravebarely escaped with his life and the goods were lost in the desert. the goods were kept in five largemetal cratesand he has heard tales of aava's work with undead chickens and magnets. he was intending to have her build him a device that could detect metal underground, but he doesn't have time to do it himself. you ask him if he has one of the crates handy, and he'll give you one. if you ask him to hire you for the task of recovering the crates, he'll say you'd only find the rugs and use them yourself, to which you reply, ""that's not a bad idea."" head todraynor manor, e.g., by using the draynor village lodestone and running north, taking the metal crate andava's accumulator, not equipped but in your inventory. if you don't have your accumulator anymore you can buy it for 999 coins and 75 steel arrows, which she also sells. enter the hidden room in the west of the manor and talk to ava about making a metal detector. she studies the crate and upgrades the device toava's alerter. in addition to an upgraded ranged bonus and all the perks it gave before, the alerter will warn you when you're near a crate which is exactly like the one you showed her. ava hides the crate in the grounds of the manor and asks you to find it to test the alerter. equip the alerter and go to the south-eastern room of the manor and pick up a spade. go outside from here and go to the hedged area in the south-west corner of the grounds. make sure you are not wearing metallic armour, or the alerter will not work. stand east of the hidey-hole tree. you will know you are at the right spot when your alerter says ""bwuk!"" four times in a single line. use the spade to dig up the crate and return to ava to tell her of the good news and she will take the crate. if you have more accumulators with you then you can now upgrade them to alerters by talking to ava again. return to the desert using the bandit camp lodestone and search for the crates in the area west of thedesert mining camp, north-east of the monkey camp. the approximate location of each of the crates is shown to the right; the exact location varies for each player. if you have metal armour to fight the scarab, don't equip it until finding the location, otherwise the alerter won't work.small scarabsmay appear when you try to dig up the metal crates, so you will have to defeat them before trying to dig up the crate again. the crates will contain either gems, waterskins, thebundle of carpets, or nothing. do not cut any gems you receive, as they can be used in the next part. bring the carpets back to the three wise monkeys and talk to them. they will then set up carpet routes with theshantay passand southernpollnivneach. iwazaru will hand you a book,economy building for dummies, detailing what items you'll need to build the colony. return to a bank, gather the supplies, and proceed with the next section. the most convenient bank is probably the chest at the shantay pass, which can be easily reached through the new carpet route. the economy building for dummies book must be read in order to be able to start this section. to start building, remove the rubble from the four building spots. build the stalls in the stall plots and build the tent in the tent plot. when the stalls are built, they must be stocked with goods. you can simply click on the stall and navigate through the interface. after building the colony, the wise monkeys will complain that they aren't adequately protected and send you to steal sixmonkey knivesfrom the king's guards. the wise monkeys tell you that you will need great strength to knock them out and pickpocket them, so you will need agorilla greegree. head back to ape atoll, take the form of a gorilla and find the building with themonkey knife fighters, located directly north oftutab's magical marketand west of the jail. punch a monkey first, then pickpocket while it is knocked out to receive amonkey knife. repeat this until six are collected. after collecting all six knives, return to the three wise monkeys and hand the knives over. after handing the knives over, talk to the three wise monkeys again to find out they are finally done with your help. after handing over the knives to the three wise monkeys, return tosenliten, where a cutscene will showosmandemanding thatleelareturn to her post in draynor, but she will refuse. in order to get the cutscene, make sure to enter the pyramid and choose the ""directly to queen"" option (if you travel via speaking to leela in draynor, first return to surface and re-enter the pyramid). senliten will congratulate you on what a great job you've done, but then she pauses and notes that something is wrong. she asks you to return to the colony quickly. you won't be able to use the magic carpet to get there, so use the bandit camp lodestone. when you arrive, you will find the colony in ruins. investigate a corpse to make adead monkeyappear. try to talk to the dead monkey; you won't be able to understand it unless you somehow figure out how to get the effects of both the monkeyspeak amulet and the ghostspeak amulet. use one of the amulets on the other to combine them to make acramulet, and then try to talk to the ghost monkey again. (you can additionally combine acamuletand acatspeak amuletwith thecramulet.) if you did not talk to the ghost first, you will get a ""nothing interesting happens"" message when trying to combine the amulets. wearing your newly combined amulet, the ghost monkey will tell you that three masked murderers kidnapped the three wise monkeys and massacred everyone else in the colony, although he will claim that he somehow managed to stay alive. the ghost monkey will tell you that he knows where they are keeping iwazaru and will direct you to thepollnivneach slayer dungeon. leeuniis the first boss monster encountered, a creation ofamascut. she is located in thepollnivneach slayer dungeonwhere thebanshee mistresswas located duringsmoking kills. however, killing amighty bansheeto pass the barrier is not required this time. on passing the barrier a cut scene will play. it is possible that the last cut scene fromsmoking killsplays when you pass the barrier, although leeuni and iwazaru are in place. in this case you will need to pass the barrier again to trigger this quest's cut scene. during the fight, leeuni can force the player's helmet off, which can cause the player to take damage from the smoke and lower their player's stats if not re-equipped fast enough. if the player's inventory is full, leeuni cannot remove the player's helmet and becomes enraged, instantly dealing damage. therefore, it is highly recommended that you keep one item slot free and watch your inventory. leeuni attacks with melee and a projectile attack that deals simultaneous damage with bothrangedandmagic. the attack cannot be completely blocked; only one portion of the projectile's damage can be negated as a result of a ranged attack in combination with the magic attack. if you should die, your grave appears outside of the well. this can easily be reached using achipped house teleport tabletor aslayer ring. after defeating leeuni, apmeken will appear. she says that ""she"" plucked words from her lips and moulded them into leeuni. she could no longer reassure the desert people, so they turned distrustful and fought with one another. you will then talk to iwazaru, and you will automatically return with him to the colony. speak to the ghost monkey again (the cramulet will be required) and he says that he's managed to locatemizaru. mizaru is being held hostage in thekalphite hivein a room adjacent to that of thekalphite queen. ayuniis the second boss monster encountered and can be accessed through a tunnel in the north wall of thekalphite queen's chamber in thekalphite hive(biq). as it is very likely that you will be attacked by the kalphite queen or one of theguardians, it is useful to bring anantipoisonfor the trip (or thepoison purge aura). it's also necessary to bring two ropes to get down the tunnel entrance if you have never visited the kalphite queen. ironmencan use practice mode to avoid paying the instance cost on creating a custom instance. you may want to get to ayuni first and quickly exit her lair through a secret entrance; this will unlock ashortcutnear the colony for quick future access to ayuni or, after the quest is completed, a room full of kalphites and one click away from the queen. if you die, your gravestone appears outside the kalphite hive in the desert. if you respawn in lumbridge, you can run back to your grave in under 2 minutes. ayuni's attacks are capable of draining prayer points, so while prayer can be used, more prayer potions are required. moving too far from her will prompt ayuni to launch a powerful projectile at the player. her melee attacks deal moderate damage, so it is best to tank the incoming attacks. after the battle, apmeken will appear again. she will say that ""she"" chipped her sight from her eyes, which bore ayuni. she could no longer watch over the desert people, so that they turned to darkness, crime and hate. equip the cramulet and talk tomizaru, and he will tell you what is going on. he says how a long time ago, when he was young, there were two goddesses: apmeken the goddess of friendship and amascut the goddess of evil and destruction. it was said that amascut considered apmeken too weak and insignificant to deal with. however, apmeken was secretly working with some of the lesser desert gods to bring peace to the desert, and they patched the ill-feeling between al kharid and menaphos. fifty years ago, the progressive young pharaoh of menaphos, a worshipper of apmeken, proposed an alliance with al kharid. amascut was furious. war was her tool for destruction. she cursed the pharaoh and hunted down apmeken. they fought in the desert, where amascut was stronger, but unable to destroy apmeken, so she cursed her by stealing her sight, hearing and speech. perhaps due to the curse, or in sympathy, the desert monkeys lost their senses, explaining the disabilities of the wise monkeys. however, amascut was not yet satisfied and forged three foul creatures from apmeken's stolen senses: leeuni, ayuni and eruni, setting them upon the monkeys. the three monkeys were able to escape by helping each other. they travelled to karamja, where they heard about ape atoll and went there, presumably the only survivors of the massacre. talk to mizaru again to return to the colony with him. speak with the ghost monkey, and he will tell you that he has found the location of the last monkey, somewhere in the ruins ofuzer. prepare for the final fight and head over to uzer to rescue the last monkey. eruniis the final boss of the quest. she is located in the demonic realm whereagrith naarwas defeated in theshadow of the stormquest, accessible through a portal located below the ruins of the city ofuzer. unlike her sisters, eruni will remain stationary in the centre of the room for the entire fight. also, unlike her sisters, she has no melee attack and only uses the projectile attack that deals simultaneous ranged and magic damage and hence can only be partially blocked. eruni has 30,000 health, and she spawnslesser demonminions periodically during the fight who have 3,000 health each. she summons demons according to her health; 1 demon at the beginning of the fight (100% of her health), 2 demons at 75% of her health, 3 demons at 50% health, and 4 demons at 25%. the demons are regular lesser demons, so they aren't difficult, but eruni takes no damage while they are active, so they must be slain in order to attack her. despite her low health, she does significantly more damage compared to her sisters. additionally, her lesser demons are not aggressive, which means you may wish to turn auto-retaliate off, so eruni's attacks do not interfere with your attempts to kill them. it is possible to safe-spoteruniby hiding behind the horn-like pillars. doing this will mitigate a large amount of damage whilst fighting thelesser demons. after defeating eruni, apmeken will appear once again. she says that ""she"" crafted eruni after stealing all sound from her ears. she could no longer hear the voices of the desert people, and she became isolated from them. soon the desert people became deaf to each other's pleas, losing reason and mercy. speak tokikazaru, who will return you to the monkey colony. once back at the colony, speak to the three wise monkeys. mizaru will say that they always meant to return, since the desert was their real home. however, life in ape atoll was comfortable and they had plenty of scope for mischief with the influx of half-witted gnomes. it was only the mention of apmeken that brought them back, along with humans who would help them build a colony. with a colony they could forge alliances with the locals and arm their guards to battle amascut's monsters. once they were destroyed, they were sure apmeken would be restored. apmeken will appear and speak to you, as your deeds have restored her senses. as the three wise monkeys cannot sense her, they will think that you have gone insane. you have a short chat with apmeken, in which she says that she will return to her duties as a goddess, and if needs be, battle amascut herself. the camp will be rebuilt with hours of your hard labour, and you can return tosenlitento finally complete the quest. she will thank you for all that you have done and reward you for your efforts. quest complete! do no evil is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:  "

house situated north of theedgeville lodestone. oziach says that, to be able to purchase a rune platebody from him, you will have to slayelvarg, the mighty female dragon, residing withincrandor isle. he will tell you to re-visit the guildmaster for information on how to kill elvarg. go back to the guildmaster. talk to him about the map pieces, about protection against dragon breath, and about buying a boat. after speaking to him about all of the map pieces, he will provide you with amaze key. travel tolumbridgeand speak toduke horacioon the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]oflumbridge castle. ask him about ""a shield that will protect you from a dragon's breath"", and when he asks you which dragon you're going to use it to fight against, tell him that you will be slaying the fearsome elvarg of crandor. he will then give you ananti-dragon shieldand tell you a bit more about the story of elvarg and the fall of crandor. to reach the island of crandor, you need to obtain acrandor map. however, for the safety of the people ofasgarnia, the map was divided into equal pieces by 3 survivors –melzar,thalzarandlozar– each of whom took and hid a map piece. the map pieces can be obtained in any order. melzar's map piece is found withinmelzar's maze, found south of thecrafting guildand directly northwest ofrimmington. to progress through the maze, you will have to get past several locked doors, using keys obtained from the monsters. barring the blue one, each key is held by a specific monster with a unique trait. the entrance of the maze is a large room containingzombie rats. to get thered key, kill the small zombie rat with the long tail. open the north-western door, and proceed up the ladder. the second room containsghosts. the orange key is dropped by the female ghost with a hood, but no cape. after obtaining the key, head through the middle door, second from the north on the eastern wall, and then climb the ladder. the third room hasskeletonsin it. to obtain the yellow key, kill the skeleton with a round shield. use the key on the south-western door and keep climbing down the ladders until you reach the basement. the basement contains twozombies. unlike the other rooms, there is no way to tell which zombie holds theblue key, so kill them until you receive one and then proceed through the blue door. you must now fightmelzar the mad. when killed, he drops the magenta key. use this key on the magenta coloured door to progress to the final room. in the final room is alesser demonwho drops the final green key. it is weaker than other lesser demons, although it still uses magic attacks. once the demon is defeated, open the final green door and take the map piece from thechestby completing the dialogue. either climb the ladder and exit the building through the entrance or teleport out. travel to theice mountain, west of edgeville and north of falador, and climb to the northern-most part of the mountain and speak to theoracleby her tent. if you previously spoke to the guildmaster about thalzar's map piece, she speaks in a riddle, which holds the answer to the location to one of the map pieces: to obtain this piece of the map, you'll need: once you have spoken to the oracle, head south from ice mountain into thedwarven mines. the mine contains a room with a sealed entrance door in the north-east part of the mines, just north of thescorpions. when you've found it, use all the items on the magical door. take care while using the wizard's mind bomb with the door, as the left-click action is to drink it. when you open thechestinside the room you get the following message, written by thalzar: search the chest after reading the message in order to obtain the map piece. either head directly toport sarim jailand confrontwormbrainor head to thechampions' guildand speak to theguildmaster. ask the guildmaster about lozar's map piece, who reveals that she had hid the map section in a safebox at her house in lumbridge. unfortunately, she was killed during a goblin raid, and the creatures looted everything from the homes. the guildmaster suggests you speak to someone in thegoblin village. speak to eithergeneral bentnozeorgeneral wartfaceto learn that the final map piece is held by a goblin named wormbrain, currently imprisoned in port sarim jail. head there and speak to him. he'll confess to stealing the map from a frail old woman and getting caught while trying to escape. there are two ways to obtain this map piece: after obtaining all the map pieces, simply use one of them on another to complete thecrandor map. the guildmaster mentions a ship for sale at theport sarimdocks, you must ask the guildmaster before the captain will allow you to buy it. at the pier, talk toklarense, the owner of the boat. he offers to sell his boat, thelady lumbridge, for 2,000 coins, which includescabin boy jenkins. however, the ship is damaged and will require repair using 90steel nailsand 3planks. board the boat and complete the repairs. go todraynor villageand talk toned, located in the house just north ofmiss schism. bring your map and ask him to captain the ship and assist you in sailing to crandor. he agrees and asks you to meet him on your ship in port sarim. when you are ready, board your ship and talk to ned. tell him you're ready to sail to crandor isle. a short cutscene will play, during whichelvargflies over your ship in circles and sets it on fire. cabin boy jenkins will panic before catching on fire and dying. elvarg flies over the lady lumbridge. elvarg, about to incinerate the lady lumbridge. cabin boy jenkins is killed by elvarg's dragon breath. the ship will crash on the shore of crandor. make your way across the island to the peak, avoiding the progressively stronger monsters. run past the lesser demons and enter the hole at the heart of the island. another cutscene plays, showing elvarg's lair – full of charred bones, skeletons, and a wall outline of a former warrior that was burnt-down – before moving the camera angle to elvarg, showing her as if she was slowly moving towards you. move past the skeletons until you see elvarg behind a short wall of spikes protruding from the ground on the east. further south, there is a passage that can be unlocked to provide a shortcut fromkaramjain case you die or leave the fight early. if this passage is not unlocked, you will have to repair the lady lumbridge again. equip your anti-dragon shield and climb over the wall of spikes. there are no safespots in the cavern and elvarg can hit up to 1,500 life points worth of damage with her firebreath attack if an anti-dragon shield isn't equipped. on death, a grave will appear inside elvarg's cave. players with level 37prayercan useprotect from magicin conjunction with an anti-dragon shield to greatly reduce fire breath damage. her dragonfire will drain your prayer points if you plan to use prayers during the fight, and not equipping an anti-dragon shield will drain your combat stats and prayer very swiftly until they are 1 and 0, respectively. defensive abilities such asanticipateandreflectcan help reduce incoming damage as well as damage elvarg in return. therevengeability can be used to provide a small buff to your damage output. although displaying no weakness, melee has higher hit chance against elvarg, followed by ranged, and lastly magic. should you be unable to defeat elvarg or die, you may venture again to crandor island. the ship will return to port sarim in its original damaged state and needs to be repaired again with 90 steel nails and 3 planks. after doing so, talk to ned on the ship to return to crandor. alternatively you can open the secret door within elvarg's area during the fight to allow future access through thekaramja volcanoand complete thecran door's secretachievement. once you killelvarg, a cutscene will play during which you cut offelvarg's headand stash it into your inventory. leavecrandorand offer the head tooziach, who will declare you a worthy member of thechampions' guildand give you your reward. if you lose the head, return to oziach and the quest will end as normal.

select the ""cyrisus in the mine"" option. after a heated conversation — rehashing the first time you and the pirate-banker met — ask him if you can get some items out of cyrisus's bank account. jack gives you achestto carry the armour, which includes a helmet, top, legs, boots, and a weapon. the combination can be deducted through a process of elimination. start with all items of one combat type and then check with cyrisus to see what items are correct. the easiest way to do this is by using thenpc contactspell to speak with cyrisus. speak with 'bird's-eye' jack again and swap the items cyrisus didn't like for the next combat type, and repeat a third time if necessary. cyrisus' armour selection is usually based onyourhighest level of combat (that is, amongstmelee,ranged, ormagic, excludingnecromancy). here are some common combinations: when cyrisus approves of your choices, go back to him in the cave and return the armour. you see a short cutscene, where cyrisus modestly puts on his kit; hisarmamentstatus will now be at 100 percent. if cyrisus's health and spirit stats are still down, embolden him and feed him the last pieces of food to raise those to 100%. another cutscene occurs, where cyrisus finally feels healthy and says that he's ""dressed like a war machine!"". cyrisus tells you of his adventures and skills, such as having travelled to the frozen wastes of the deepwildernessand being capable of plantingspirit trees. yet despite his skills, he has a fear of combat and actually came to see if themoon clancould help him. he plans to visit his dreams again and conquer his fears. he asks you to go talk to theoneiromanceron lunar isle and says he'll meet you there shortly. outside on the isle, head south to the lower tip to find the oneiromancer. she is near theastral altar, so watch out forsuqahs. talk to the oneiromancer and select the ""cyrisus"" option, and cyrisus arrives near you. the oneiromancer says that with a certainpotion of shared dreaming, you and cyrisus can travel todreamlandand help him overcome his apprehensions. the oneiromancer gives you adream vial (herb), while cyrisus teleports away, asking you to meet up at theceremonial brazier. the potion requires anastral rune. to make the potion, add the ground rune to the vial to get adream potion. bank and prepare for four fights. remember, you cannot bank between fights, therefore if you leave the dreamworld you will need to start over at the beginning. do not bring anything that you cannot afford to lose on death. aring of lifewill not activate during the fights and you cannot bringfamiliarswith you inside the dreamland; boosted stats are retained after entering the dreamland. during the fight, a bar will appear at the top of the screen, showing cyrisus' courage. it fills up as you constantly damage the monsters. as it rises, cyrisus will occasionally castvengeance otheron you, and when the bar is full, cyrisus will himself deal some damage to the monsters. if you die, your gravestone will come up near cyrisus. have anenchanted lyreor runes formoonclan teleportready in case you die for a quick way to get back to lunar isle. alternatively,home teleportto an activatedlunar isle lodestonemay be utilised. head over to the west side of the town, into the building that has theceremonial brazierand meet up with cyrisus. light the brazier, talk to cyrisus, and proceed into his dream. you see a short cutscene, where while you gape at the huge creature that symbolises cyrisus's fear while he admires the lectern. inadequacy is apparently the major cause of cyrisus' insurmountable fear of combat. bring plenty of food, even in your best gear a few rogue hits could kill you. the first monster, a level 98 creature namedthe inadequacy, summons many little creatures calleda doubt(level 77) during the battle to help attack you. the inadequacy uses melee and ranged attacks and is immune to poison. the next entity is a level 93 creature calledthe everlasting. it attacks relatively slower and less accurately than the inadequacy. there is a safe spot to the side of the lectern that will keep you from being hit if using range or magic. although using this is an advantage, it may backfire with one ill-timed movement, causing the everlasting to trap you and force you to tank its high hits. the everlasting is a fairly easy boss to overcome, if you can hold your own for some time. the third monster,the untouchable, is easier still — at level 98. it uses a fairly slow melee attack, however has the highest melee accuracy of the four monsters. you can also safe-spot this monster by using the same place as you did for the everlasting. another efficient way to kill it (if you run out of food, for example), is to use the hit-and-run tactic. run a few squares away from it, strike, and run away again. doing this will allow you to kill the monster without taking much damage. the fourth monster,the illusive- level 88, has the ability to dig into the ground regularly during the battle, similar to when you fight thegiant mole, except that the illusive does not burrow as far away. its only attack is a relatively slow melee attack that rarely hits much, and it very rarely retaliates when attacked. be patient, as you can only hit once or twice before it digs underground again. a good strategy is to return to the middle of the platform, making it easier to spot its new location, as it pops up as a yellow dot on theminimap. after defeating the illusive, cyrisus, now brimming with bravery, stomps on it to finish it off and vanquishes his fear once and for all. back in reality, head back to the oneiromancer and inform her of cyrisus' victory. he suddenly teleports in and thanks you for your help by passing some of his knowledge onto you. dream mentor is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

option. he will tell you he needs assistance with getting a herb calledgoutweed. if you can't start the quest, try going through the ""secret entrance"" and freeingeadgarlike you didgodric. only the trolls in thetroll strongholdknow where to find goutweed, so sanfew will suggest you speak to his friendeadgarwho lives near there at the top of trollheim. eadgar's cave is found on top of the mountain with the thrower trolls, the world map marks this as trollheim. it is also marked by a mini obelisk icon on the world map. there are several methods of reaching the cave. the most direct method is to break atrollheim tabletwhich takes you directly to the outside of the cave (after the completion oflove storyandchippy transport). a second method is to travel tofairy ringcodeajr, placing you near a path leading up the mountain. the path leading up the mountain is north-east of the fairy ring. if you do not have access to the fairy ring network, you can also use the fremennik provincehome teleportto reach a similar starting point. you will need to use climbing boots to climb the rocks and then pass through a ""secret entrance"" immediately to the north, leading into the camp stronghold from which you left during the quest. from there, go north past the column of jail cells climb up the stairs at the end of the chamber. pass through the prison door to the west and climb the stairs you encounter. head south and halfway along the hallway you should see a cave exit. exit the cave to end up just east of the troll stronghold. finally, head up the eastern mountain to the top of trollheim. alternatively, you can make your way totrollheimusing the same route as in thetroll strongholdquest. equip yourclimbing boots, go northwest fromburthorpeand follow the path through the dwarf's cave. climb over the rocks and either head west toward the ""secret entrance"" previously mentioned, or head east through thetroll arena. follow this path and run past the thrower trolls. low-level players should useprotect from rangedif possible, as the rocks can cause lots of damage very quickly. if you have 47+agilityyou can avoid the thrower trolls completely by using the agility shortcuts on the mountain. once at the peak of trollheim, enter the ""cave entrance"" to a crescent-shaped cave and ask eadgar about goutweed. he will recommend you go see atroll cook. leave eadgar's cave, go back down the hill and head north west, following the path round into the troll stronghold. if possible, useprotect from meleeif thetrollsattack you. head south once in the cave to go down the stairs. you will see four troll cooks here – one of them will be calledburntmeat. there are no aggressive trolls in this area. speak to burntmeat and he will offer to tell you about goutweed in exchange for a human to cook in his stew. agree with him, then go back and talk to eadgar. upon returning to eadgar, he will tell you that he needs a parrot in order to fool the trolls into thinking you have given them a human. go to the zoo inardougneand talk toparroty peteat the north part of the zoo near thewolfenclosure. he will tell you that their favourite food ispineapple chunks, and that they will get drunk if you feed themvodka. be sure to ask him both of the possible questions or else you will not be able to mix the ingredients. use your vodka on your pineapple chunks to makealco-chunksand then use them on the aviary hatch on the west side of the parrot cage (be careful to 'use' rather than 'drink' the vodka). you will obtain adrunk parrotand will tell parroty pete that you will take it to the vet. if you drop the parrot it will fly away and you will need to go back and talk to eadgar to get it back. take the parrot to eadgar. he will tell you that you need to make it look like a human, taste like a human, smell like a human, and talk like a human. first, to make it talk like a human, you'll need to hide it on the bottom floor of the troll stronghold under a torture rack north of the cells in the prison (from the cave entrance, go north, then down the stairs, then east through the door and down the stairs). here, it'll pick up the 'right kind' of sayings. leave the parrot under the rack and go collect the required items before heading back to eadgar. if you attempt to pick up the parrot before bringing the other items to edgar, you will remark that the parrot is not done learning yet. next, take care of the other tasks. these tasks can be done in any order: note: it is not possible to obtain the dirty robe before talking to eadgar about it. after you have given him all of the items he requested, eadgar will tell you that you need to make atroll potionso thatburntmeatwill not lie to you about the goutweed. search around the outside of eadgar's cave until you find atroll thistle. switching tohigh detailmay help players spot the troll thistle. note that it spawns in a different area every time it is picked. if you search and cannot find it, try logging into a different world. once you have found it, dry it on a fire to turn it intodried thistle. there are fires outside the troll stronghold, but you can also set your own fire. then grind it in thepestle and mortarto makeground thistle. finally, add it to yourunfinished ranarr potionto make atroll potion. talk to eadgar again. he will take the potion off of you and tell you that the parrot has heard enough by now, so you can get it back. go back to the prison cells in the troll stronghold and search the rack to retrieve the parrot and then give it to eadgar. he will make the parrot into afake manand give it to you. return to the cooks in the stronghold and give the dummy to burntmeat. he will give you a piece ofburnt meatas a reward. he will also tell you that thegoutweedis kept in the storeroom and that you can find the key by searching the kitchen drawers. search the drawers in the south east corner of the room, and once you have thestoreroom key, go down the stairs on the north wall of the kitchen, and follow the hallway to thestoreroom. here you must sneak past the guards to get to a crate with the goutweed. if one of them sees you, he will knock you out and send you just outside of the storeroom. you can follow right behind the trolls or right next to them and you will not get hit. sometimes while running through guards, if you are one square or so away, they will not notice you, especially at the door. the only way for them to kick you out is if they face you. if you can avoid doing this you will be able to get the goutweed. methods for getting past the trolls: search the crate and you will obtain some goutweed, after which you will get caught. it is possible to click the crate opposite the crate guard and then you can just stand there. if you do not wish to take damage after getting the goutweed you can flash protect from range when you get the message that you got the goutweed. this will block the damage. give the goutweed to sanfew to finish the quest. congratulations, quest complete! eadgar's ruse is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

if you have access to thefairy ringnetwork, the codeakqlands you near thepiscatoris fishing colony, and travel south from there. you can also teleport tohet's oasiswith aring of duellingand travel using thegnome gliderto thetree gnome strongholdafterthe grand tree, or you can simply use thebook of char's teleport option and run north to the tent. if you have started thememorial to guthixdistraction and diversion, you can use yourmemory strandsto teleport just north of the campsite, making this the fastest travel method possible. go to the north west side of the mountain's base, where you will see a campsite. inspect the pile of books to find abird book, then click on it to retrieve themetal feather. from here, climb up the rocks next to the campsite to reach the rocky outcrop at the top of the mountain. use the metal feather from the book on the rocky outcrop to open the door. then, go inside. afeathered journalis just inside, but though amusing, it is not critical to the quest. the passages split to three tunnels to other areas and another metal door, used later, and to a ledge over a large open area. first, walk towardsnickolaus. acutscenewill start when you enter the ledge and you will talk to nickolaus, who is trapped across a chasm by a giant eagle that will not let him out of the cave. if you accidentally skip the cutscene by clicking to walk, or by other means, you can click on nickolaus to shout at him, ultimately talking to him. while you are in the dungeon pick up 10giant feathers(named eagle feathers in the inventory) for use later. nickolaus tells you to make a disguise for him. talk to him about eagles, mention that he is trapped and offer to help. to make the disguises, you'll need 10giant eagle feathers, which are all over the dungeon, in addition to 1swamp tarand 1yellow dye. teleport tovarrockand go to thefancy clothes store(not the costume/clothing shop at the centre of varrock) located in the south-east corner of the city, past the fenced gate and to the east of a bar. theshop ownerwants 10 giant feathers to make the costumes plus 1 swamp tar and 1 yellow dye. the swamp tar can be found incanifisandlumbridgeswamp respawns or simply bought from thegrand exchange. the yellowdyecan be bought from the seamstress inlletyaorardougne, thegrand exchange, or fromaggie, the witch indraynor, by using 2onionson her (plus a small fee of 5coins, of course). when you bring all the items (10giant eagle feathers, 1swamp tar, 1yellow dye) and additional 50 coins, the fancy-dress shop owner will make twoeagle capesand twofake beaks. if you happen to lose your costume, the fancy dress shop owner will make you another if you bring him the materials and 25 coins. with the two sets of disguises, go back to theeagles' peak mountainagain. go back up the shortcut and talk to nickolaus. he wants you to bring the clothes to him. there is a door in the dungeon with a large eagle marking that leads to nickolaus. you cannot open the door in this state. three feathers (abronze feather, asilver feather, and agolden feather) are required to be able to open the door. west of the eagle door is a tunnel. this leads to a room with a stone pedestal on which sits abronze feather. when a player attempts to take it, a net trap will lift it upwards. only once the net trap is holding the pedestal out of reach it is possible to operate the winches. operate all four winches in each of the corners, causing the net trap to break. the pedestal will fall down and it is possible to take the bronze feather. after that leave and follow the directions to the silver feather cave. a bit further north, a second tunnel leads into another dungeon room, this time with an empty pedestal. inspect the pedestal and a partial trail will appear. follow the trail and inspect the closest heap of rocks to the end of the trail. if you are correct, the trail from the pedestal is shown to the heap of rocks, and a new partial trail starts. repeat until the trail leads to an opening in the wall. click the tunnel in the wall now and a level 14kebbitwill attack. once you've killed it, take thesilver featherby clicking the opening again and put it in the door. (usingring of recoilto kill it works without getting any combat experience.) if for some reason you don't have the requiredhunterlevel (27 or higher) you won't be able to see the trails and won't be able to get the silver feather. the third tunnel entrance is to the east of the main dungeon (opposite where you first entered the cave system). you need to get to the end of a long corridor due west from the entrance. the corridor is blocked by metal eagles on tracks and eagle-winged gates. the birds can be lured to a feeder by puttingodd bird seedin a feeder along the track while the gates are opened and closed using levers in the area. there is a reset lever outside of the gold feather cave. in disguise walk past eagle after right clicking on it and choosing the walk-past eagle option the door with all three feathers in it after collecting all three feathers (bronze, silver and gold) use each feather on the door to open it. walk to nickolaus by clicking on the giant eagle while wearing the full eagle disguise. if you are not wearing a disguise, the eagle will knock you back dealing up to 100 life points of damage. after a short conversation, nickolaus requests you to meet him back at the camp. go back out of the eagle peak mountain dungeon and walk back down to the tent you were at before (or take the rock climbing short-cut). talk to nickolaus and he'll teach you how to catchferrets.
go back toardougnezoo with a caught ferret and talk to charlie and quest complete! eagles' peak is not currently required for any quests or miniquests."

he thinks that even though many eggs are being born different or dying, his egg is stronger and will be a great tzhaar. he asks you to help. mej-akand mej-jeh will help you to keep the egg within the optimum temperature for hatching. to do this, the tzhaar will provide runes (during this section only, none are actually added to your backpack) so you may castfire spellsto heat it up andwater spellsto cool it down, keeping it between the two markers on the temperature gauge, which move up and down as time passes. you don't have to be on thestandard spellbookand no magic experience is gained. you will be given three types of fire spells and water spells; fire bolt to wave and water bolt to wave. the mejs will automatically use fire spells once in a while to heat it up. use the fire spells when the mej tells you that it is too cold, and water spells if it is too hot. cast a spell once; you certainly don't want to overheat it or make it too cold by spam casting a spell. once the percentage is high enough, the required temperature will rise into a new band, with a smaller interval between the markers. you will need to raise the temperature into this band quickly, using the more powerful spell, otherwise the percentage will fall quickly and the band will revert to its previous position. there are three different temperature bands. if the hatch percentage reaches 100, the egg will hatch, but if it reaches 0, you must start over. despite your efforts, the egg hatches asga'al. mej-ak takes it away to join the others in thetzhaar fight pit. mej-jeh explains thatga'al-jehis sentenced to die in the fight pit because tzhaar are useless without memories, and the society does not have any way to teach new skills. more and more eggs are dying or hatching as ga'al, and it is becoming a problem for the race. mej-jeh thinks he has a way to give the ga'al their memories back, but he doesn't think the other mejs will approve. they think the tzhaar shouldn't go back ""there"", but mej-jeh thinks it is the only way to save their racial memories. but he needs a ga'al to test his theory on and he has chosen his son, ga'al-jeh. you now need to retrieve ga'al-jeh from the main plaza, west of the hatching pools. talking to him shows that he is unwilling to leave.ga'al-xox, another ga'al in the area, also refuses to return in place of ga'al-jeh. talk to mej-ak. he will tell you that you'll have to protect the ga'al from death in the fight pit yourself if you want to rescue it. you will need to be prepared for a moderately hard fight against high level enemies involving all three styles of the combat triangle. you are allowed to bring familiars, but they can't have anything in their inventory. thus, a good choice would be a healing familiar such as aunicorn stallionor a combat familiar such as asteel titan. the player spoofs are weak to fire spells, arrows, and stab attacks, so bringing these styles will prove helpful. the hardened tzhaar have no weaknesses. high level players with over 70 attack, strength, and defence or ranged or magic do not need to exploit weaknesses and can instead use one combat style for the entire fight pit. at the start of the fight, theplayer spoofsare either fighting each other, or one of the tzhaar in the area or ga'al-jeh. at the top-left corner of your screen you will see the remaining health of ga'al-jeh, which you should aim to keep as high as possible since it doesn't regenerate and can't be healed. when you attack a monster in the area, it will focus on you. you can use the centre of the area as safespot, and possibly trap thehardened tzhaar-ketnear ga'al-jeh to let him act as safespot against other melee enemies. protect prayers or deflect curses can be used to reduce damage from both the tzhaar and player spoofs alike. however, thetzhaar-xil (hardened)use two attack styles, ranged and a basic melee attack. mej-ak observes the battle behind a hot vent door at the south-east corner of the arena, which also serves as the only exit. there is no penalty for letting ga'al-jeh die, you just have to try again. if you die, you respawn in the main plaza, lose no items, and have your stats fully recovered. the following strategies always assume the player could kill the opponent in question in a timely fashion. players should always prioritise those attacking ga'al-jeh. a good strategy is to take outodischampimmediately, as he starts off attacking ga'al-jeh. be sure to useprotect from magicordeflect magic, since he can hit fairly high withancient magicks. finish him as quickly as possible. then, attack thewesttzhaar-xil, who will be either idle or ranging ga'al-jeh, from asafespotwithprotect from missilesordeflect missiles. at first he will range, but later on he will use melee attacks. meleeing at close range is trickier (thoughprotect from meleeordeflect meleecan greatly help), and inexperienced players are strongly recommended against bringing combat summoning familiars, as this would make the xils' attacks more unpredictable and harder to pray against; seetzhaar-xil (hardened)for more details. the tzhaar-kets will be busy fighting each other, so ignore them for the time being. thesouthtzhaar-xil is usually the next to kill its opponent,firecapezorz. don't attack it unless it starts attacking ga'al-jeh, as being attacked by two of the xils can be extremely dangerous. deal the south xil in the same way. kill the remaining ket if it starts attacking ga'al-jeh. by now,noremorse77should have started attacking ga'al-jeh, so attract her attention as well.lolthenkillandfightpitpker's battle should be over soon afterwards, and whoever won will be at low health, so use the appropriate protection prayer or curse and finish them off. noremorse77 shouldn't be a problem, since she apparently lost her dragon claws before the beginning of the round. make sure to keep an eye on the remaining tzhaar-ket, as it can easily kill the ga'al if not focused on you or glitched. after killing all the enemies in the fight pit, mej-jeh and mej-ak will have a short conversation, and then mej-ak will calltzhaar-ket-yit'tal, the tzhaar champion, to kill ga'al-jeh. he uses melee only, so if you have enough prayer left, you can just pray against melee and fight him until he dies. the tzhaar champion will begin attacking you immediately, so having a melee protection prayer as your quick prayer option is recommended. yit'tal can drain your prayer points when attacking you. the pillar in the centre of the fight pit acts as a safespot. yit'tal has no weakness, so dispatching him shouldn't be a problem if you are using a strong enough weapon.
this fight should be very easy if using the safespot or praying with enoughprayer potions. if you die during the fight with the yit'tal you won't have to do the pits again, you will only have to kill the champion. clicking away during the conversation allows you to bank before attempting the champion. after the fights, talk to one of the mejs. after a conversation about how mej-jeh wants to transfer the tzhaar's memories usingtokkul, he will send you to the kiln to transfer the memories fromket-yit'tal's tokkulto ga'al-xox, the only ga'al remaining from the fight pit. the kiln can be found to the east of the main plaza. the western tzhaar-ket at the entrance will give you access to your bank, allowing for quick restocking of supplies after clearing each checkpoint. proceed to the kiln and try to enter the cave, where a guard will warn you that he can hear someket-zekin the cave. if you plan on actually fighting the ket-zek, it is advisable to bring a ranged weapon and ammunition. you will not be permitted to bringsummoning familiarsinto the kiln. if you have started thebattle of the monolithminiquest to the point at which you need to ask thetokhaarfor help, you will not be able to proceed with the elder kiln quest at this point until the tokhaar have joined at the monolith and the fight has been completed. after entering, you will encounter a short cut scene in which ga'al-xox will stop following after you jump a narrow chasm. you will teach ga'al-xox how to venture across and then it will continue to follow you. praying against magic whenever you see enemies in these caves is highly recommended as, even with high magic absorption, you may suffer devastating hits from thelava monstersor even the ket-zeks later on. deflect magic is particularly useful as it will slowly but surely chip away at the health of multiple monsters at once. every cave in this area is safe and you will keep all your items when you die. to minimise the amount of consumables you use, dying on purpose allows you to return to the bank at the entrance and will completely restore all your stats. entering the cave again puts you to where you left off, but you'll still have to clear out the room from scratch if you didn't before you left or died. if you log out in these rooms, you will appear outside the caves and arrive at your last checkpoint when you go in the caves.as you proceed you will encounter three lava monsters and atoktz-ket-dill. if you are familiar with this monster from the questtoktz-ket-dill, the procedure remains the same: break its armour with melee combat while having a high-level pickaxe in your tool belt (or wielding the pickaxe) and only useprotect from meleeordeflect meleeafterpenetrating its armour while wearing full melee armour. a halberd works well against the ket-dill. it is recommended to first prayprotect from magicordeflect magicand defeat all of the lava monsters before taking on the ket-dill. the ket-dill can easily be trapped behind a lava monster in the meantime. while it still has its armour, the ket-dill will occasionally perform a stomp attack incurring unavoidable damage. using a melee protection prayer before breaking its armour will cause it to use its stomp attack frequently, inflicting upwards of 200 damage every time. if you're wearing an aura, the text: ""your holy aura appears to enrage the toktz-ket-dill"" will be shown, meaning the ket-dill will use a magical attack. players should be cautious. once you have cleared all these monsters, you can proceed into the next room. before doing so, you'll be required to investigate the skeleton by the end of the cavern to receive thejournal of perjour. it's not immediately useful, but you can read it for a note on the tzhaar numbering system as well as for some brief writings oncharand the journal owner's fate. in the next cavern, you'll find 100tokkulon the ground. it will be useful later, so pick it up and keep it in your backpack as your proceed through the caves. you will eventually encounter twoket-zekand more lava monsters. if you have curses active and do not want to fight the ket-zeks, just turn on deflect magic and use the reflected damage to slowly kill the ket-zeks (and any lava monsters attacking you). as long as you stay out of melee range and don't run out of prayer points, they will effectively kill themselves for you. if you wish, you can use ranged gear or a halberd to speed up the process. however you go about it, the ket-zeks must be defeated before you can proceed into the next room. you can usedreadnipsto kill the ket-zek, but you must attack them once in a while then step out of their melee range. the next room contains four more lava monsters and another ket-dill. the ket-dill can be trapped behind any of the corners of the west rock. after defeating the monsters in this cave, you will come across a giant door and someancient scales, which you must balance with a certain amount oftokkulto open the door. this is where thejournal of perjouryou obtained earlier comes in handy. refer to the note in the journal to decode the messages that the ancient scales display. the note is exactly the same as the one in thetzhaar tourist guidefromtoktz-ket-dill. the amounts specified are shown in thetzhaar language. they are different for every player. the player will be hit for 300 damage if an incorrect amount of tokkul is placed on the scales. your progress with this puzzle is saved, so the 100 tokkul you picked up earlier should be more than enough to activate the scales. the numbers arebase 12not base 10. the + in front of 2 digit numbers counts as 12, and may explain the ""difference"" of players being off by 2. note the difference between vertical and horizontal lines, for example 2, 3, 4 and 6. the ancient gate will open once the correct amount of tokkul has been placed on each scale. jump across more chasms and you will eventually come across another ket-dill. after defeating it, keep proceeding and enter the cave entrance. upon entering the next room, you will be confronted by ayt-mejkotand three more lava monsters. like with room 1, it would be a good idea to pray magic first (the yt-mejkot can be trapped behind the lava pool in the northeast) and clear out all the lava monsters before praying melee and tackling the yt-mejkot. though it can heal itself and others like in thetzhaar fight cave, you should still be able to kill individual lava monsters without the yt-mejkot causing much trouble. there is a safe spot for ranging/magic just east of the room entrance. when you finally enter the kiln itself, you will have a brief conversation withtokhaar-hokbefore being attacked by seven waves oftokhaarcreatures, in a manner similar to thetzhaar fight cave. this fight, like the entire quest, is safe; but it is still difficult and should not be underestimated. if you leave the caves, die, or log out/lose connection, your wave progress is reset. the kiln waves contain five kinds of monsters: tokhaar-hur, level 100 – melee, weak against water spells tokhaar-ket, level 180 – melee, weak against water spells tokhaar-xil, level 140 – ranged, weak against crush tokhaar-mej, level 160 – magic, but will hit melee at close range, weak against bolts tokhaar-ket champion, level 105 – melee, will periodically drain prayer points, no weakness the waves, which are the same for every player, are as follows: every monster can hit through prayer, but prayer greatly reduces their attack accuracy and damage. attacks that are prayed against shouldn't deal more than chip damage, but it can still add up over time. the general approach to each of the 7 waves is: it is vital to use terrain to limit the number of monsters attacking you so you are only facing one combat style at a time. if you are not, do your best to trap tokhaar-kets (tokhaar-hurs are less of a threat and can be tanked for some time) and quickly eliminate the style with the fewest users so you can pray against the remaining distanced combat style and be relatively safe again. a good safespotting location is the ""t""-shaped barrier near the north-west corner of the combat area (the bottom of the ""t"" is attached to the western edge of the combat area). this is a good location for multiple reasons: once all the waves are complete and the champion has been defeated, tokhaar-hok will appear in the centre of the arena, beckoning you to speak to him. he will tell you that he is a tokhaar, the original species the tzhaar are derived from, and are continuously reborn by the kiln, in which they were created. you convince hok to allow your ga'al to be reborn in the kiln. reborn, ga'al-xox complains of the sheer pressure of being in tokkul form. you and the ga'al are then sent from the kiln, with hok and other tokhaar hungry for more battle. now, you will need to return to the tzhaar city. along the way, the ga'al will talk to you about the new memories. tokhaar monsters ambush you at specific points. they should not be a problem because just four appear and you can easily outrun them. if you are killed while running through the caves you do not have to redo the battle. after you leave the caverns, ga'al-xox will ask you to meet it in the main plaza. go to the main plaza and speak to either mej-jeh or mej-ak to enter a cutscene. the ga'al will be asked to prove he has tzhaar memories by defeating atzhaar-ket (hardened). after he does, he will explain that being turned into tokkul is torture and will plead that more ga'al shouldn't be infused with memories. no matter what the player says, the mejs will ignore the ga'al's warning. you'll then see a cutscene of ga'al-xox returning to the kiln and tokhaar-hok talking. congratulations, quest complete! ga'al-xox kills a hardened tzhaar-ket ga'al-xox tries to convince the tzhaar to not send any more ga'al to the kiln. ga'al-xox talking to tokhaar-hok the elder kiln is

(note: if you receive the message ""the furnace needs to be hotter to be of any use."", refer toelemental workshop ifor troubleshooting.) now head back into the middle room and open the hatch. once downstairs, players need to fix the machinery. first off, take both schematics,craneandleverschematics, from the schematics crate south of the stairs, near the lava pit. players have to take both of them. read the crane schematic. go back upstairs and use one of the elemental bars on the workbench. smith an elementalcrane claw. go back down the hatch and lower the claw using the lever that is one square to the east of the schematic crate. make the repairs by using the claw in the inventory with the claw on the crane. once it's repaired, raise it again using the same lever. (note: if you use the lever and a message says the system is not pressurized; go to the first workshop (on the top level) and activate both the waterwheel in the northern room and the bellows in the eastern room by the valves or lever next to each. then go back downstairs.) place an elemental bar on the jig cart. lower the crane again, and it should pick up your bar. raise the crane again. now, rotate it by pulling the lever immediately to the east, placing the crane above the lava. lower the crane again using the first lever. this should dip your elemental bar into the lava, making it orange. raise the crane again, then rotate it with the second lever once more so you can place it on the jig cart. lower the crane, automatically leaving the bar on the jig cart, and then raise it. to the immediate north (2 steps), there is a small area with a lever and a picture of a mine cart. pull the lever, and the jig cart and bar should move on to the next step, the press. if you use the third lever before the bar is dropped, you will have to pull the lever multiple times until it is back under the crane. use the short staircase on the south-west or north-east corners to get to the upper gantry area. move to the western side of the room over the press to get to the junction box. open the junction box to work on the pipes for the press. to connect the pipe junctions, simply click on one pipe section and then click the section to which you want to connect it. players should arrange them as seen in the image. for the first pipe, connect it with the top number 1 (going from left to right) to bottom number 3. for the second pipe, connect top number 2 and top number 3. for the third pipe, connect bottom number 1 and bottom number 2. once they are connected in the proper way, go back downstairs and pull the lever that is next to three small pipes west of the mine cart sign. this should flatten the bar. now, go back to the jig cart controls in front of the mine cart sign and pull the lever once. it should now move on in front of a water tank to the north. for the next two parts, search the crates to find asmall cog,medium cog,large cog, and apipe. the location of these items is random for every player. there are crates on the walkway above and underneath each set of stairs. go up the stairs and use the pipe in your inventory on the pipe with a hole in it in the north of the room, above of the water tank. the piping must be repaired before proceeding. go back downstairs. there are two valves to control the water to cool the bar: one to the east and one to the west. if the cooling chamber in the northern section of the room has water in it, turn the east water valve to open the drain, then turn the east water valve again to close the drain. pull the old lever in front of the jig cart to open the door. next, turn the corkscrew lever twice, which moves the jig inside the chamber. seal the water hatch again by pulling the old lever. to flood the cooling chamber, turn the valve on the west side once to open it, then turn it again to close it. to empty the cooling chamber, turn the east water valve once to open the drain, then turn it again to close it. pull the old lever, and turn the corkscrew lever twice to bring the jig back onto the track. finally pull the old lever to close the chamber door. your bar will turn blue/white when it's ready, but it may seem orange again for the next step. pull the jig cart control lever in the middle room in front of the mine cart sign and the jig moves along to the next area. take the three cogs to the machine on the east side. the side of the machine contains three pins. use the large cog on the pin to the south. the medium cog goes on the lower pin and the small cog goes on the upper pin. turn on the fan with the old lever to the south of the machine, then turn it back off again. if the message says the fan is sucking but it should be blowing, then the cogs are not on the correct pins. turn the fan off and position the cogs correctly. if the machine says ""it must be powered somewhere else"", head upstairs and make sure the water wheel to the north is rotating. if the water wheel is not rotating, pull the lever near the wheel. go back to the jig controls in front of the mine cart sign and advance the white primed bar back to the south under the claw. take the whiteprimed barfrom the jig cart. use the stairwell under the hatch in the north-west of the main room to go down another level, where there are two sets of doors: one with the mind symbol and another with the body symbol. the body door cannot be opened yet, so go into the mind room. place the primed bar on the extractor gun (a small table next to the extractor hat) then operate the extractor hat. you will temporarily lose 20 magic levels, as your skill level is drained to turn the bar into an elementalmind bar. pick up the bar from the extractor gun. any number of elemental mind bars can be made as long as the magic level does not fall below 20. there is no danger of dying or losing life points, unless no bar is placed under the extractor gun, in which case your character receives a shock, depleting 10% of your lp. if your magic level is less than 20, you cannot even sit in the chair. players can use astat restore potionhere. now, simply go back up to the workshop on the top floor, and, with thebeaten bookin inventory, use the mind bar on the workbench to make amind helmetout of the elemental mind bar (you will need to select the drop down at the top of the smithing interface and select mind equipment). you no longer need the beaten book to make mind equipment. to make amind shieldrepeat this process on anotherelemental bar. congratulations! quest complete! elemental workshop ii is

vitruvius amputates the limb but vowed to re-arm his assistant one day. go to theworkshopby clicking on the ""odd looking wall"" in the house with the anvil, and climbing down the stairs. now, obtain 3elemental oresby killing a fewearth elementalsin the western chamber. you must turn each of these ores intoelemental bars, by using a piece of ore and four pieces of coal on a furnace - you may use the one in the southern chamber. make sure you've read the book, and use thesoft clayon the ragged book to make akey mould. with the key mould in the inventory, use one elemental bar on the furnace to make aragged elemental key. climb down a level in the workshop and prime the remaining two elemental bars (seeprimed baron how to do this). after you've created the primed bars, head down another level and use the ragged elemental key to unlock the 'body' door halfway down the hall on the west side. you will now be in a large chamber with a small room in front of you, and a large, geared mechanism below it. proceed down the steps near the 'body' door. the purpose of this mechanism is to charge the body room above, with body energy and allowing you to convert a primed bar into abody bar. ultimately, you must lower the central tower, spin it, and raise it again - this process is depicted on ascrollthat can be found inside a crate in the north-west corner. note that whenever you are on this floor, a magnifying glass icon appears in the minigame hud. clicking this icon toggles between the normal view and a bird's-eye view of the lower level, making it easier to move around the mechanism. the puzzle mechanism is in the form of a large square matrix, with levers located in series on every side of the matrix. there are six initial geared blocks, a charging tower and an empty space inside the matrix. additionally, there are two counters lying on the left and right sides of the matrix, and a moving drive gear occupying a tile on the bottom-centre edge. the objective of the puzzle is to form a connection of gears from the drive gear to the various key points in the matrix. upon entering the puzzle room, an interface will display the layout of the room and location of the levers. you can control the levers by clicking on them within this interface; you can also physically move around the room to pull the levers. moving a lever will slide all pieces perpendicular to that row (or column) of the lever, and in the row (or column) of the empty space, towards the empty space. the counter above the matrix shows the allotted number of moves; every pull of the lever that moves one or more tiles decreases the counter by one. when the counter reaches 0, no more pieces can be moved and the puzzle must be reset by pulling the reset lever next to the counter. an undo lever is also provided; however, it only has an undo-memory of one move. notes: as a quick reference, each of the levers have been assigned a number or a letter (as shown in the image on the right). also note that pulling the lever on the opposite side of the matrix has the same effect. objective:connecting the driving motor block to the north terminal of the right-side counter. to create the connection, pull the levers in the following order: once you have completed it successfully, a cutscene ensues showing a two-layered cog being lowered. reset the puzzle using the lever above the puzzle matrix. objective:to connect the driving motor block to the south terminal of the right-side counter. (this part of the puzzle isoptional. if you do choose to complete it, you will gain an extra 50 moves, which allows you to make a few mistakes in the next section without having to reset the puzzle.) to create the connection, pull the levers in the following order: another solution, with less levers: when complete, your counter will now obtain a cap of 50 moves. pull the reset lever again. note that no cutscene would play after completing this; the only notification for successful completion is the increased move cap. objective:to connect the driving motor block to the north terminal of the left-side counter. to create the connection, pull the levers in the following order: as you put the final block into place, a three-layered cog is lowered onto the matrix floor. pull the reset lever a third time. objective:to connect the driving motor block to the south terminal of the left-side counter. to create the connection, pull the levers in the following order: completing this section puts the left counter out of order, providing you with infinite turns. pull the reset lever. objective:to connect the driving motor block to the top-centre terminal of the matrix. to create the connection, pull the levers in the following order: this effectively lowers the central tower. pull the reset lever. objective:connecting the driving motor block to the central tower. to create the connection, pull the levers in the following order: the middle tower should now be spinning. do not pull the reset lever - doing so will require you to get the tower spinning again. objective:raising the spinning tower back up to enable you to charge the room above with 'body' energy. make sure that the puzzle looks exactly as shown inthe above 'spinning the tower' stepfor the following instructions to work: instead, if you have a similar combination, but with the left and right sides inverted, use: the tower should now be raised and the room charged with the 'body' energy. do not pull the reset lever. go upstairs and insert one of theprimed barsinto the slot next to the door, to unlock the room. enter it, flip the lever to close the door and push the big red button to infuse the 'body' energy into the primed bar and create abody bar. make sure the central tower is charged and in its highest position, or else the button will not be usable. hitting the button also temporarily drains yourdefenceby 33, so if your level is below 66 you must use your restores or boosts now. you need two body bars to complete the quest, hence you will need to recharge the room again by lowering, spinning and raising the central tower a second time. flip the lever to open the door and retrieve the body bar. go downstairs and pull the levers in the following order: guide position if your puzzle is inverted, use the following: inverse position once you've done this, head back upstairs and insert the second primed bar and repeat the steps to create the second body bar. with theragged bookand twobody bars, use a workbench on the first-level basement to smith thebody body. congratulations, quest complete! elemental workshop iii is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: a method to prime one bar in four moves.

these)","the elemental workshop ivis the fourth part of theelemental workshop quest series. the quest continues on themes of the previous quests in the series, uncovering the cosmic and chaos portions of the elemental workshop. start the quest by searching the northern bookcase on the ground floor of thesorcerer's towerto find anotched book. the tower is located south ofseers' village(just east of thestormguard citadel dig site). on the floor next to the bookcase there is aknifeyou can take if you don't already have one. read the book and head to the anvil room directly west of the bank inseers' village. once in the building, before going underground, use a knife (if you don't already have one, there is one in the north-east corner of the ground floor of the house with a sink in it in seers' village) on the whetstone near the anvils in the southeast corner of the room to create akeyblade. the keyblade will be necessary in order to access the cosmic and chaos parts of the workshop. open the odd-looking wall and head down into the workshop. if you do not already have two primed bars, you will need to make them before continuing with the quest. each primed bar requires 4 pieces ofcoaland 1elemental ore. elemental ore may be obtained in the western part of the workshop by attempting to mine one of the purple veined rocks. this will bring anearth elementalto life, which must be killed in order to obtain an elemental ore. using the coal and elemental ore on the furnace in the southern portion of the workshop will result in anelemental bar. by processing the bar through the conveyor belt and jig machine system one level below, the elemental bar will be turned into aprimed bar. proceed into the bottom floor of the workshop, where the mind and body rooms are found. this can be accessed through a hatch in the north-west corner of the priming room. when on the bottom floor, use thekeybladeon the door at the southern end of the hallway. you will lose the keyblade, but the door will be unlocked permanently. after entering through the door, head east through the cosmic door into the pillar room. the room will contain a matrix of pillars with coloured circles on them along with a control panel (in the southeast corner) to interface them. the goal of the puzzle is to line up the coloured circles of adjacent pillars so that a beam of light may pass through without interference. as each stage of the puzzle is completed, the succeeding stage will be more difficult, involving more pillars and more possible levels through which the light may pass through the puzzle. the colour of the light is dependent on what rune is placed on the emitters on the walls of the room.fire runescorrespond to red light,waterto blue,earthto brown, andairto white. some of the emitters already have runes in place, but you may have to place runes in most of them so that the correct colour beam is emitted through the correct row or column. from the control panel interface, it is possible to adjust the height of the emitters. this is not necessary for the first puzzle, but the height of the emitters may need to be adjusted for the other two. the pillars may be rotated from the control panel interface in order to line the colours up. when the colours have been correctly lined up, pressing the ""power up"" option will send beams of coloured light from the emitters through the pillars. if the puzzle is not correct, the beams of light will be obstructed and be unable to pass through. in the second and third puzzles, the control panel can also be used to change the height of the emitters using the sliders around the edge of the grid of dots interface. this is necessary to complete the 2nd and 3rd puzzle as there is no way to fully match only the bottom stories of the pillars. moving the emitters up or down allows the player to match different stories of the pillars and still complete the power up. one tip for solving this puzzle is to line up one line of pillars successfully. there is only one possibility for matching a row, so this dramatically limits the ways that the other pillars must face. use this tactic to create something of a process of elimination and complete the puzzle with relative ease. if you are successful, beams of light will pass straight through the pillars, activating the next stage of the puzzle. after completing all three puzzles, click - or right click - on the draining machine in the very south-east corner to operate it. this will start a cut scene where theautomatonin the machine is activated and opens the chaos portion of the workshop. before heading to the chaos room, place one of yourprimed barson the shelf (jig) on the right side of the machine (the shelf was behind the automaton and is visible after it leaves.) return to the control panel and power it up. note: because one of the pillars will have turned after you powered up the machine, operate the control panel once more to correct its alignment and operate the machine again. then operate the draining machine, retrieve a yellowcosmic barand head upstairs to the nearest workbench and makecosmic gloveswhich you will need in the next room. (you must have the notched book in your inventory to make the gloves). also note that operating the draining machine will drain your runecrafting level. solution to the first puzzle solution to the second puzzle solution to the third puzzle after making thecosmic gloves, head back down to the lowest level of the workshop. go through the door thatda-vi(the automaton) opened which leads into the chaos room found opposite the cosmic room. in the north-west corner you will find ashabby bookon the table. take this and read it. the basic idea of this puzzle is to give da-vi commands by feeding an instruction cube with an address cube into the cpu. the player must use the ram device to select 2 cubes to be sent to the cpu device so da-vi may perform the task. unfortunately, you will find that a few of the essential command cubes have not yet been placed onto the conveyor belt. your job is to instruct him to retrieve the missing cubes so that you can, ultimately, instruct him to smash through the wall containing the chamber where the chaos machine is located. further complicating matters, one location or ""address"" is broken (astral plate). you will need to use other commands to fix this tile in order to get the plate needed to access the chaos machine. on the south-east side of the machine, there are a series of levers. the two on the south-facing wall operate the rams, which send cubes into the cpu. the four other levers all activate the conveyor belt, moving the cubes on it either five steps or one step in either direction; the northernmost one runs five steps counterclockwise, the next down runs only one step counterclockwise, the next runs one step clockwise, and the last one runs five steps clockwise. if you put the wrong instruction into the cpu, right clicking it gives a ""flush cpu"" option to clear it out. to operate the computer, da-vi must be given an instruction and an address, represented by two cubes in the cpu (in any order). the instruction cubes are ""get"", ""put"", ""break"", and ""operate"". ""get"" will make da-vi pick up objects at the address, if able. ""put"" will make him put an object he is holding down at a specified address. ""break"" will make him smash one of the two ""temporary walls"" on the south side of the chamber. ""operate"" is used to power up the chaos machine. the addresses, all named after runes and their symbols, are the large stone tokens with rune symbols on them. note that the astral token is broken, so this must be fixed before da-vi can be issued a command involving it. you will need to have da-vi smash the wall, then retrieve a blank token from the south-western corner and put it on the workbench. you carve a new astral icon on the token, then you pick it up and replace the broken astral token. if the symbols on the blocks are hard to see, hover over the block with your mouse to see what it is. the machine will only execute a command when a pair of cubes (instruction and address) have individually been rammed into the cpu (in either order). the conveyor belt can be moved any time, so the required cubes do not have to be adjacent to end up in the cpu together. to repair the astral floor token, the instructions are: this should have put the cube with the law rune on it onto the conveyor belt. this should have put the cube with the fire rune on it onto the conveyor belt. this puts a blank token on the workbench. you must then carve it using a chisel and hammer, and you receive anastral token. use the token on the broken astral token to replace it. to break the second wall, da-vi needs to get the earth cube, which requires getting the astral cube first. so now you should tell da-vi to: this should have put the cube with the earth rune on it onto the conveyor belt. this instructs da-vi to break the second wall, then turn the chaos machine on. you cannot safely use the chaos machine unless you have equipped thecosmic glovesyou made earlier. you will take damage and have to instruct da-vi to turn it back on, however, you will not be drained of thieving levels if you misfire the machine. if you do the steps in the wrong order and get stuck with the automaton holding a uncompletable step, (i.e. holding the fire cube without breaking the wall), simply use the put + shelf rune (that has nothing on it) to make the automaton place the incorrect cube on the shelf. you can also do the step put + mind to make the automaton put what he is holding onto the workbench. once you are properly prepared, place a primed bar on the machine table and operate the draining machine to charge it into achaos bar. this machine will drain your thieving level by 39. if players want to make more chaos bars, they must go back to the cpu and again enter: operate + chaos remember to wear your cosmic gloves. to complete the quest, the player must make at least one set ofchaos boots- which requires having theshabby bookin your inventory to make, or else a message will appear saying ""you don't know how to work this bar yet."" it is suggested to either use super restores, find a creative way to die (bank your items first of course), or teleport to daemonheim, enter a dungeon and then exit, as 39 thieving levels will take roughly 39 minutes to recharge normally (1 level per 60 seconds). once the desired number of chaos bars has been acquired, return upstairs to the first basement level and use the bar(s) on the workbench (with the shabby book in your inventory) to make your choice of chaos equipment. congratulations, quest complete! elemental workshop iv is not currently required for any quests or miniquests."

you also have the choice of using your own head, but lazim refuses to allow it. to create the head, mine a 5 kg block of granite from the quarry and chisel it into a visage of your choice. you will need to create another head later, so mine a second 5 kg block of granite but do not chisel it yet. place the completed head onto the statue; suddenly, unable to bear the weight, the ground collapses beneath the site of the statue and lazim pushes you into the gaping hole. if you need to leave the area, you can do so by climbing the ladder near lazim, then climbing the sand pile. there is a rock directly east of the former statue location that will grant you access back in the temple. you find yourself in an ancient temple, the statue shattered and lazim standing beside you. confront him, and he'll confess that he isn't really a sculptor, and that he had you construct the statue solely to access the temple. you start to leave, but lazim entices you, offering a portion of whatever they find in the temple. you agree to stay, and lazim explains that the treasure can be found at the top of the temple and to reach it, you must first pass the unique doors on the current level; instead of keys, 'limbs' must be used on each entrance to unlock it. lazim tells you to salvage the broken statue to obtain the required appendages. while you're here, ask lazim for the statue head as you'll need it in the next section. take the silverm sigiloff the nearby pedestal, and use a chisel to carve out astone left arm,stone right arm,stone left leg, andstone right legfrom the statue. go north and go around the dungeon floor by walking in a counter-clockwise circle; attempt to open the doors that you come across, and the appropriate limb will automatically be used to unlock it. watch the cutscenes ofenakhraandakthanakos, and take ther sigil,k sigil, andz sigilin the respective chambers; these, with the m sigil, make up the consonants ofzamorak. enakhra completes the temple. the avarrockians attempt to kill enakhra... but have failed. athanakos attempts to convert her to the zarosian side. enakhra tricks akhanakos into thinking that she's changed and freezes him to become aboneguard. enakhra's love for zamorak is endless, and she attempts to create weapons for him. after you've unlocked all of the outer doors, proceed towards the center room and use the corresponding sigils to unlock the inner doors. climb up the ladder there and you'll find yourself faced by a magical barrier, and another pedestal. place the statue head that lazim gave you on the pedestal; the skull fits except for ""one gap at the end."" use a piece ofsoft clayon thepedestalto make amould, and then use this pattern to craft your remaining piece ofgranite (5kg)into a newstone head(choose ""craft"" option on the granite). fit the granite camel head into the pedestal, and another cutscene ensues. using a second soft clay on the pedestal will create a camel mask that you can use for yourself. lazim now appears next to you. when you tell him about the strange visions, he explains that they were traps set to disorient any unwanted visitors. lazim tells you that the treasure is still a floor up, and you must pass the magical barrier to reach it, which can be brought down from the four enchanted rooms on the floor. each chamber on the floor represents a globe on the pedestal, which are based on the four classes of theancient magicksspells. you must light each of the globes before you can pass the magical barrier and progress further. the recommended order in which the rooms should be solved are: melting the ice fountain. lighting all the braziers. clearing the smoke in the furnace. after all the four globes are lit, you'll be able to pass through the barrier. climb up the ladder and talk to lazim, who artlessly tells you to be cautious of the traps ahead. head south and climb over thepile of bones. climb down the stone ladder and speak to theboneguard, who tells you that it was put underenakhra's control, the coward who hides in the temple after being rejected by the dark lord. the boneguard asks you to help weaken her grip over him by completing the wall between them and sealing her in her own temple. agree and take three sandstone blocks from the nearby pile of rubble and use them on the wall, using your chisel to trim each brick after you set it up. once you've built the wall, enakhra wails out; the boneguard thanks you, before changing form and revealing himself to be thezarosianmahjarrat,akthanakos. a final cutscene plays, wherein enakhra easily breaks through the wall and confronts akthanakos, threatening him for destroying zamorak's weapon and taunting him. after their short verbal bout, they both teleport away towards thenorth. enakhra's lament is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

to start the quest, player should travel toentrana, wheremost equipment is banned. you can get there with awicked hoodteleport tolaw altar, or teleport toport sarimwithcaptain's logorport sarim lodestoneand take the ship by talking to the monks there. speak toauguste, who is on the west side of the island, just north offrincos's fabulous herb store. auguste requires about two dozen items to make two test balloons. to save time, gather these items before starting the quest. most can be bought from thegrand exchange. he requires 3 papyrus, 10 silk, a sack of potatoes, a ball of wool, 8 sacks, a candle or black candle, a bowl, yellow dye, and red dye in total. you can give the items to auguste before they are needed. upon first arriving in entrana, head to the farm north-west of the ship and pick 10 potatoes, and use them to fill up an empty sack to get asack of potatoes. after collecting all the materials, talk to auguste, who intends to be the first balloonist in all of runescape and needs an assistant. he will tell you that he needs to perform two test runs. the first test requires you to make a model of anorigami balloon. usepapyruswith theball of wool, creating aballoon structure, and then use an unlitcandleon the balloon structure to get an origami balloon. do not launch the balloon or else you will have to get the items again! talk to auguste to see a short cut-scene of the balloon launch. after that, talk to him again and he will take the remaining two pieces ofpapyrusand thesack of potatoesfrom you. in a second cutscene you launch the next balloon, which is attacked and set on fire by a mob of angry peasants. due to limited inventory space, it is recommended to bring the 2 dyes, 10 silk, 1 bowl, and 8 sacks or sandbags together in one trip, and then the 12 willow branches after as the branches cannot be turned in until the previous items have been received by auguste. no items can be noted, so multiple trips between a bank and auguste will be required. a bowl can be obtained from the building directly east of augusteentrana -1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]if you do not already have one. after the tests, talk with auguste, who will require players to gather the materials for a real balloon. auguste will give the player a basket of apples and asapling, awillowtree. its advised to get branches from the grand exchange. fill the empty sacks at the sandpit just south-east of auguste, to make sandbags. give the dyes, pieces of silk, bowl andsandbagsto auguste, then use the willow branches on the frame of the balloon to weave a basket. you see a short cutscene of the completed balloon. after weaving the basket and with logs in the inventory, speak to auguste to get ready to fly. he'll describe some of what the player should notice and some tips on how to fly the balloon. the player will see the balloon-control interface. manoeuvre through the obstacle course without hittinganything(including birds, trees, houses, and clouds) and safelylandon the well-marked landing spot on the third screen. note: there is a bug where the controls show up, but the visual of your balloon does not. following the recommended path below carefully will still complete the quest; although using the balloon system after that will be difficult. the numbers at the side of sack and log buttons correspond to how many times player can use the resources, respectively; therefore, fuel is limited. if player runs out of fuel they can still ""relax,"" or lower altitude by pulling ropes. how the balloon appears to travel is not as important as where it will end up. if the balloon meets a cloud right above it and a bird in front of it, it is possible to go right between both obstacles by dropping sacks or pulling the red rope, raising and dropping the balloon by 2 spaces, respectively. the balloon will fly high or low enough to avoid the bird and will advance one space forward to avoid the cloud. it might not seem like the balloon can fit through, but it can. when ready to fly, you will move through three screens, showing your flight path to taverley and balloon control interface. there are various ways to control the balloon, and the following is just one of the suggested paths; however, using this path is highly suggested, as it works consistently. if you crash, you have to run back, get more logs, and return to the island, which turns what is a medium-length quest into a long one. (there is currently a bug where the interface will not show the three screens, failing the user on the first normal rope lowering.) (if the screens are bugged and don't show but you can still interact with the controls follow the instructions exactly below and you'll still successfully arrive in taverley - confirmed 28/08/2020) taverley screen 1: drop sandbag, burn log, relax (x9), pullredrope, relax (x2), pull normal rope 1, relax (x5) taverley screen 2: burn log, relax (x2), burn log, relax (x10), burn log, relax (x4) taverley screen 3: relax (x7), pullredrope, pull normal rope, relax (x3), burn log, relax (x4), pull normal rope the balloon should end up one space above the landing pad, with no air space in between. flying past the landing pad would get the balloon blown away, and getting the balloon in the space with landing pad would cause it to smash to the ground: in both cases the flight, would be considered unsuccessful. player needs to restart the flight by gathering the logs again before going to entrana. thankfully, the balloon is intact. after the balloon has landed, talk to auguste to finish the quest. enlightened journey is not currently required for any quests or miniquests."

north-west and you will discover that you look like evil dave. climb the cellar stairs back up to edgeville and speak to doris, who thinks that you are evil dave. after some conversation, it becomes apparent that you and evil dave have swapped bodies. however, doris doesn't believe you and instead grounds you and commands you to do chores. search the wardrobe to the north-east twice to collect atattered old broomandbed bug cleaner. click on the rug in the centre of the room to sweep it with the broom to complete the first chore. search the shelf on the west side of the house to obtain

complete, head back upstairs and speak to doris to inform her that you have completed all of evil dave's chores. she teleports to thegrand exchangeto get some groceries, warning you that leaving the house will make you ""double grounded"". as you are now home alone, you are free to explore the basement. head back down and search any of the bookcases, using the second option if you want to skip extra dialogue. the first one has some puns based on famous real life books and fourth wall breaking. you will receivedave's spellbook, but it can't be looked at without knowing the correct command phrase. search the drapes to the north of the basement, near the bed, to discover a hidey hole containing a note along with onelaw,earth, andair rune. finally, search the boiler in the south-eastern part of the room to find another note with a spider attached. this causes you to freak out, which is odd because you are not usually scared of spiders. interact with dave's spellbook and your character will open it with the command phrase ""evil is the best"". unfortunately, you can't perform the ritual without evil dave being there, so you plan to intercept him infaladorwhen he tries to spy on saradomin's meeting. to do so, you decide to seek out themakeover mageto transform yourself into a female version of dave, davegelina. to teleport to the makeover mage, interact with dave's spellbook again and select the first option. if you interact with dave's spellbook again and get the message ""i don't need to use the spellbook right now"", interact with the drapes once more and the option to teleport to makeover mage will appear. instead of teleporting to the makeover mage, you actually end up in the grand exchange, where doris is purchasing her groceries. you quickly teleport behind cover to make sure that she doesn't spot you, and then consult the spellbook to see what you did wrong. realising that evil dave has swapped the labels around in the book, you are ready to try again, but not before needing some more runes. head north-west and speak to any of the bankers to attempt to access evil dave's bank. the banker explains that there is a competition on today sponsored byaubury's rune shopto win an earth rune. the competition is to guess the number of runes in a jar, of which there is only one. after saying this to the banker and confirming your answer, you receive an earth rune. continue speaking to the banker and they will allow you to access evil dave's account, which contains various random items, anemergency flask of stew, and a law rune. speak to any of the grand exchange clerks to attempt to access the grand exchange. the clerk refuses because evil dave is banned from using the grand exchange after buying all of theshadow dyethat was available. request some air runes. the clerk will provide them, as long as you get them a drink. try to give them the flask of stew, and they will explain that it is too spicy. head to any water fountain, drink the stew yourself, and then use the empty flask on a fountain to fill it up with water. go back to the grand exchange clerk and provide him with theflask of stew-water, who gives you three air runes. now that you have all of the runes you needed, you will teleport to the location of the makeover mage. you begin to speak to the makeover mage and try to explain that you are not evil dave, trying to validate your point by recalling your previous encounters with the mage, such as when you needed agoblin potion. the mage recognises you, and you begin to explain your predicament of swapping bodies with evil dave. they transform you into a woman, and you become davina, as the mage remarks that davegelina isn't a good name. as you're out of runes, the mage teleports you back to evil dave's house just in time for doris to arrive home. talk to doris and she will be surprised at the fact that you smell fresh, asking you if you went outside. select any of the options three times and you will eventually blurt out that you went to the makeover mage because you identify as a female. as you left the house, doris double grounds you, and requires you to do the chores again. repeat what you did before - sweeping the rug, washing the dishes, and chopping the vegetables. each time that you try to complete a chore, the tool you are using breaks. after attempting the chores, speak to doris to learn where you would hypothetically get replacement tools if they broke. she tells you that you would visiterniein hisgeneral store. open the door and select the first option to leave the house, then run north to the general store. talk to the shopkeeper to get replacement tools, which he provides free of charge. head back to the house and complete the chores again, then go to the basement and clean evil dave's bed again to experience another cutscene. dave, still disguised as you, is infalador parkspeaking tosir tiffy cashienabout becoming an elitewhite knight. he tells dave he needs to revisit his training, so requires him to defeatsir leye, and deal withsea slugs. after promoting him to an probationary temple knight white knight, sir tiffy takes dave to saradomin's meeting inwhite knights' castle. after the cutscene is finished, go back upstairs and tell doris that you have completed her chores again. she teleports away to visitgertrudeand tells you not to leave the house again. go to the door and choose the second option to leave the house, then the first option to sneak into white knights' castle. you will arrive at the top of the castle, where awhite knightis standing guard with his back towards you. go to the west and search the suit of armour to receive aknight's helmet, then continue west and search some crates for alump of gunpowder. use the lump of gunpowder on the helmet to receive aknight's helmet filled with gunpowder. pick up thehand-written noteon the floor nearby and use it on the helmet to receive aknight's helmet filled with gunpowder and a fuse. go to the torch hanging on the wall near the crates and use the helmet on it. go to the white knight and click on the helmet in your inventory to throw it, distracting him, at which point he will go to inspect it, before it explodes and sends him flying over the parapet. he will leave behind hischarred white boots, which have no use in the quest, but can be picked up. you will need to navigate your way past a series of guards with patrol routes, so keep an eye on where they are walking and walk behind them so that you are out of their line of sight. keep travelling north-west, using the various walls on the roof as cover, until you make it to the castle door. you will arrive in a room withsir amik varze. talk to sir amik varze to discover that he is drunk. he will begin to bark out orders for drinks. you have four chances at providing him with the drinks that he requests before you are tossed out and returned to the area you started in on the rooftop. pay attention to your chatbox and on-screen messages as sir amik requests drinks. go to the nearby keg and grab the drink that he requires, then talk to him to give it to him. after providing him with five drinks successfully, he recognises you as evil dave and accidentally reveals the location of the secret meeting,kalphite hive. you will teleport home just before doris gets back. sir amik varze goes through dialogue quickly. if you are having trouble try using your number keys and spacebar to select the dialogue option. the drinks are: get drink from the keg and select appropriate dialogue option. talk to amik, and go through his dialogue. repeat five times. although you can only get one drink from the keg at a time, you can have more in your backpack by dropping them one by one on the ground and picking them all up. if you are tossed out, any drinks on the ground will disappear but any in your backpack will be kept. you may have to grab multiples of each drink, due to the fact he may ask for the same drink twice. if you are unable to complete this in the normal way, you can collect a few drinks on each attempt and bank them. once you have enough return with them in your backpack, and you will be able to serve the required drinks from your backpack. talk to doris when she arrives home, who notices that you are covered in mud. after discovering that you went outside again, she will triple ground you and order you to complete the chores again. complete all of the chores (tools and soap can be reclaimed) - sweeping the rug, washing the dishes, chopping the vegetables, and cleaning dave's bed in the basement. you nap again, and witness another cutscene. the cutscene begins with evil dave talking toshantayto try and gain passage through theshantay pass. shantay allows dave through, and he continues on his way towards the secret meeting in the desert. you are awoken by doris who tells you she is going out again. before you can do anything,kevinexclaims thatmargarethas come over with her ""kids"" again. talk to margaret, who is ahell rat, in dave's basement. she wants you to take three of her children out with you, so click on any three other hell rats to recruit them to your squad. head back upstairs, and you will find you've arrived at shantay pass. talk to shantay, who will confiscate your cleaning products, but he will not allow you to take your hell rats into the desert, meaning you will have to find another way to pass. go to the north-west and shake the coconut tree to receive acoconut. pick it up, and then attempt to open the nearby jail door to speak to a shady stranger. he wants you to quench his thirst before he will leave the jail cell. speak to shantay to crack the coconut open, and then click on the coconut shell to add a hell rat to it. climb up the rope to the north-east of the area, and then click theshell-ratto throw it over the pass. your first hell rat has been smuggled. head back to the jail cell and speak to the stranger again, who you will give the coconut drink to. once you're inside the cell, talk to theshady manwho gives you ajewel. search thebarrelto the south of the jail cell to receive abarrel, then add a rat to it. take theold rugfrom dave's bank using the ""shantay chest"", and use it on the barrel to receive acarpet barrel. roll it through the pass to smuggle the second hell rat. finally, speak to the nearby border guards. they will give you a rope in return for the jewel that you have. use the rope on the nearby coconut tree to pull it down and launch your last hell rat through the pass. go south and talk to shantay again, who will allow you to pass through into the desert. you will arrive at a location between theriver elidand the kalphite hive, with multiple holes that you can reach into. one of the holes is sparkling. reach into it and you will send a hell rat down to scout around. it will inform you that it can hear voices talking about a ceramic vase, which it has got confused with sir amik varze. your perspective now shifts to the hell rat, who you must now control to find the correct hole through the cave. if you enter the wrong hole, your progress gets reset. look around for a hole that is shining, indicated by particles above it, and then enter it (the correct hole is also the only one with a quest icon next to it). you will have to do this four times to reach some white knights standing at a mysterious entrance. attempt to enter the entrance and you will be able to spy on the meeting. sir amik varze and saradomin are preparing an offensive against zamorak, who is alone in his chamber. they plan to use theresource dungeonsto make their way to daemonheim and confront him. after the cutscene ends, enter the mysterious entrance to find evil dave. you explain to dave that he is making a mistake, but are then interrupted by saradomin detecting you in the room. still taking the form of you, dave recites a spell which summons zamorak to the dungeon. ablack knightunties you, leaving you free to grab dave. run to the south-east and grab dave from underneath the empty cooking range, who you persuade to come with you. you both teleport away from the dungeon before a battle starts, arriving neargoblin village. doris is nearby and catches you both, taking you back to dave's house. back in dave's basement, clean the bed again and you will explain to the hell rats how you have been body-swapped with dave. explaining that you need to perform the ritual to swap yourselves back, the hell rat says that it could help you do it as hell rats are evil. walk around the room and collect five hell rats to help perform the ritual. after you're done, collect another one to begin the ritual. doris will arrive in the basement and be caught in the middle of the

go up to investigate. adark portalwill have appeared, emitting dangerous quantities ofshadow anima. go back inside and talk to seren. seren will explain that the portal is one of the twoshadow breaches.moiawill ask if it was the same one, but seren explains that there was always two; one contained ongielinorand the other wild. however, it should have not have been able to reach freneskae and she assumes thatzaroshad played a role in its arrival. she suspects that whatever zaros did, the shadow breach is trying to find the eggs. more sounds will come, which you recognise of that askerapac. you will askvicendithasand moia to come, whilehannibusandadrasteiastay behind to guard seren. kerapac will then sensejas' arrival, but he defies her, usingthe needleto delay her advance. he will tell you to head intoerebusto find something to end jas for good, wondering what you are due to your immunity to it. the presence ofshadow animainerebusprevents the player from remaining there for long, and you will have to traverse the realm to find something to harmjas.kerapachelps you withthe needleto create time loops to progress through the puzzling environment. the debilitating nature of shadow anima also greatly reduces the player's movement speed. the players can initially explore erebus for a minute before kerapac pulls you out. when this happens, some of the environment in erebus resets to its initial state, but the player gets to keep any items they have found anderebus rift attunementthey have gained. this is necessary to happen multiple times to finish the section as the player reaches dead-ends and uses the effect to duplicate some of the items found in erebus. the timer starts counting down once the player moves in erebus and pauses for any dialogue. after 20 attempts additional time can be optionally added–one second for each additional attempt; talk tokerapacif you want to toggle this handicap. scattered across erebus areshadow animica rocksand bothregularandskittish motes of shadow anima. the rocks must be mined to obtainshadow animicawhich can be crushed for 4% attunement each, and the motes must be captured, likewise for 4% attunement each. the player has to reach 100% attunement by finding all 25 of these objects. none of the objects re-appear after attunement is gained from them. telekineticandabyssal soul remnantsmay be captured to obtain the corresponding items. the enduring soul remnants (obtained from the telekinetic soul remnants) are used to levitate variousbouldersin erebus, making the player able to move them as they please, while abyssal soul remnants are used to transforminactive riftsintorifts, enabling the player to move between the islands. only one of each soul remnant can be carried at a time. as your attunement grows, you will gain the following benefits: the following checklist may be followed to find the required objects and activate the idol of the leviathan. if the time runs out at any point, simply repeat as many steps as are required. theextra action buttonmay be used to exit erebus early. upon activating the idol, ashadow leviathanwill be alerted to its activation. sliske's masks will tell you to leave before it arrives and you will find yourself back onfreneskae. a cutscene will begin whenjaswill break throughthe needle's effects. before she could do anything, ashadow leviathanemerges from the breach and fights jas.kerapactips the balance towards the leviathan's favour, but with the needle broken, he too is dragged intoerebusalongside jas before the breach shuts. collect the fiveneedle shards(four of these are used later on in the quest; the fifth is used after the quest) and then talk to anyone. anecho of kerapacwill appear, delighted that he had finally gotten his vengeance against jas, and that despite being in danger himself, will relish whatever torment jas suffers along with him.hannibustries to reconcile kerapac andvicendithas, but neither wants to do so. descend the ledge to the north to go back down into theelder halls.serenwill be alarmed as she realises that the needle is now broken and a shadow breach is loose ongielinor. the group will try to convince her the best way to deal with the eggs, with hannibus suggestingiaiato let them die in peace. seren refuses to let them die and teleports away, leaving behind aportal. use theportalsouth of theenergy riftto teleport toiaia, prompting the group to realise thatserenintends to hatch the eggs on the planet. she ignores the group's pleas, believing that they're trying to kill theelder godsoff. with no choice, the group settles on evacuating as manyilujankaas possible. hannibuswill lead the group south toelder chahoua. chahoua believes the end of times has come, butvindictarefuses to let everyone die and tries to get the few younger ones to leave. the group will scatter to begin the evacuation efforts; you will be tasked with finding any in the current village. speak to thepastkeeper,pondkeeper,plantkeeper, andcraftmaster. the pastkeeper will refuse to leave but hand you apastkeeper amuletto give tosharrigan. the pondkeeper will ask you to catch some of the fish from thefishing spotin the nearby pond, giving you afish bucketandsmall fishing net. catch four fish and return to him. the plantkeeper will refuse to leave, buther sisterdoes and asks you to collect seeds from four plants around the village using aseed bagbefore she goes. two of the plants are next to the pair (flowering marsh plantto the north-east androundleaf marsh plantto the south-west), while the other two are further down south (marsh-fire plantis south of the roundleaf marsh plant andlongleaf marsh plantis south-east of that, close to vindicta). the craftmaster will ask you to collectsome toolsaround his workshop (visible as three red dots to the east on theminimap) before he leaves. after everyone from the current village leaves, the group convenes to start evacuating the next one. however, seren begins the process of calling the elders as they need to come at a precise moment to pass their memories down. while she does not like this path, she does acknowledge your soul and whatguthixhad seen to appoint you as his world guardian. vicendithas will suggest delaying the process by using theneedle shardsand map down the most optimal spots. after placing twoneedle shards,serenwill begin initiating combat with the player. this is a dangerous battle with three phases, and yourgravestonewill be placed by theworld gateif you die. however, each phase serves as a checkpoint, so if you teleport or die during the fight, you will resume from the start of the phase you left off at. seren creates a rectangular barrier with no way for the player to escape other than dying or teleporting during the phases of the battle. in the first phase, she will create alight lord,dark lord, andshadows. attacking either lord results in them becoming immune with the chatbox message ""my attacks are just going straight through it"". attack the shadows, which leave behind alight core, then attack either of the lords with the light core to destroy the core and damage him for 1,000 damage, accompanied with the chatbox message ""the light core is absorbed into the [dark/light] lord"". repeat this ten times to reduce either lord's health to zero. after a lord is dead, the remaining lord is fully healed and two masses ofunstable energyappear. click the unstable energies and move them onto the remaining lord a total of four times for 2,500 damage per hit to kill him and lower seren's barriers, allowing you to place a third shard and finishing the first phase. the second phase of the battle features seren summoning avestige of mahand amah wisp, along with severalmuspah(bladed,force, andthrowing). kill the muspah to make the wisp vulnerable to damage, then attack the wisp. you will be allowed to lower the wisp'slife pointsdown to 40,000. usingsoul splitwhile damaging the wisp can help recover some health if you need it. afterwards seren will summon three more muspah: alarge bladed muspah, alarge force muspah, and alarge throwing muspah. repeat the process to lower the wisp's life points down to 20,000, at which point a trio of even more powerful muspah will attack: anenraged bladed muspah, anenraged force muspah, and anenraged throwing muspah. after these are killed, the wisp can be destroyed and the manifestation fades away, allowing you to place a fourth shard and move to the battle's final phase. it's possible to use adeathtouched dartto kill the mah wisp after killing the initial three muspah to finish the phase. the third and final phase begins with seren summoningremnants of herselfthat launch waves of fire on command, dealing around 2,700 magic damage per hit. this hit will ignore most defensive abilities. soon after, she will have the eggs rumble around the arena, emitting shockwaves of similar damage and effect. the damage can be reduced with the use offortitude, theaegis aura,aegis blood essenceandanimate dead.resonancecan be used to heal off of the shockwaves if necessary. afterwards, the eggs will summonaspects of serenthat attack with magic and have 1,500 life points, while incorporating the fire waves and egg bursts. there is a safe spot for the first wave of egg blasts next to the plant arrangement near the sixth remnant of seren by the hill. killing the aspects is not necessary; you only need to survive for roughly two minutes.tank armouris strongly recommended here, as is a shield, for use ofbarricadeandresonance. apowerburst of vitalitycan also prove helpful for increasing your chances of survival. prioritise avoiding the eggs and the waves of fire by running perpendicular to the waves. staying in the waves by not moving or running horizontally within them will deal continuous hits and kill you quickly. after surviving this wave,adrasteiawill urge you to leave through the gate, butmoiawill betray you and shut it off before you are able to reach it, declaring thatzamorakwill be grateful for the world guardian's death and leaving you stranded. you may attempt to use the gate but it will not respond. theelder godsthen arrive and hatch the eggs, destroyingiaia. somehow, you survive. you will then find yourself in your mind consciousness, whereserenexpresses surprise that you were somehow spared fromthe great revision, before noticing thatguthix's enhancement had protected you. however, the power you acquired fromerebusis gone. seren herself was spared because the elder gods recognised her. as the hatchlings emerged from a non-perfect world, they're far weaker but she promises to keep them on iaia and protect them from the dangers of the universe. you may choose to either trust or distrust her but either way she will be set in her decision. she also warns you to stay away from her or her new family before dismissing you. back at theworld gate,moiatries to convince the group that you had died when you suddenly appear before them. you accuse moia of assassination, which she doesn't deny becausegielinorcan't be claimed if its protector is around. while she did prioritise gielinor's safety first, she thought it was also a good chance to eliminate the world guardian at the same time.adrasteiawill be shocked by moia's betrayal, but moia states that she doesn't have the experience of war and teleports away before anyone could react.hannibusmourns the death of his home world whilevicendithasleaves to console him, who tells you to inform the gods atsenntisten. return to the dungeon via the quest option and head back to thecathedral. you will ask the gods where everyone went.saradominwill tell you that after they were relieved of the eggs, they made short work of theelder gods' forces;tzkal-zukwas forced back to theelder kiln,azzanadrareturned thearch-glacortoleng, whilecroesuswas completely incinerated. the gods did not know wherekerapacwent, as he was missing by the time they reached thecolosseum. you will tell them of his sacrifice and what happened toserenand the eggs. the gods fear thatthe great revisionwould start anew, but you tell them that seren pledged to keep them oniaia, convinced the universe was too dangerous for them. they then ask ofjas, of which you tell them she was banished toerebus, much to azzanadra's surprise. you then inform them of moia's betrayal. the gods will thank you for your services; saradomin will leave with adrasteia to oversee recovery efforts infaladorandarmadylteleports toprifddinasto honour the agreement he made with seren. azzanadra will ask to speak with you outside, needing some fresh air. outside, azzanadra is content with peace and still maintains a firm belief thatzarosis still out there in erebus, having been forsaken in his wisdom. azzanadra will thank you for saving the universe. extinction is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: i took them to freneskae. i thought we would be safe there. jas found us. there was nothing we could do to stop her reclaiming the eggs. she could kill us all with merely a word. no power in this universe could stand in her way. i did not expect you to find it in another. the shadow leviathan struck without warning. i felt its presence tear into our reality. it was kerapac that broke the balance. heedless of the terrible pain his defiance earned him, he directed the full force of his artefacts towards their creator. its power spent, the needle broke. distracted, jas was overwhelmed. the monstrous intruder dragged its prey back into its own realm. without the needle, kerapac was powerless to avoid the same fate. its hunger satisfied, the breach snapped shut, leaving in its place a terrible silence. jas was the greatest of us all. irreplaceable. her loss forced me to accept something. your survival depends on our deaths. they reached down from the sky, the hands of creation itself, to birth their waiting children. as they touched the eggs, memories passed from one generation to the next. aeons of identity, stretching back through time. the eggs burst open. as the lifeless bodies of the adults fell, the power of the newborn children drained all life from the planet. all life. the children. my family. at last, they live. they know me. they love me. they spared me. they have fulfilled their birthright. all other life on iaia is gone. but you...survived. how? the official quest artwork. april 2022 update banner. art by maximus gugu commissioned by jagex to announce the update. new model for moia made for this quest. model for ""hebe"" (adrasteia) made for this quest."

at first he blabbers incoherently, but eventually starts to poke inside your mind, enabling you to communicate with him. hazelmere will ask you to clear your mind and think of nothing, so he can show you his memories of the gnomish history. during thefourth age, healthorg had just become king and the gnomes occupied most of the northern regions, with the south inhabited by goblin tribes. aiming for control over the land, both the races eventually met in thebattle of atarisundri. easily outnumbered by the goblins, glouphrie came up with a plan to use his special illusions to scare the goblins away from the land. he summoned an army of giant tortoises, successfully intimidating the goblins into retreating and thus gaining victory. shortly after this, hazelmere recounts having a very special, old friend in a spirit tree,argento. one day, he sensed theanima mundileave his dear friend, although the ""weather was fine and dry"". sure that one of the old ones had died, he conveyed his concerns to oaknock, who immediately accused glouphrie and his illusory practices. oaknock, along with help from the elves, created an anti-illusion machine to dispel the illusion cast on argento and prove glouphrie's treachery. calling upon the council to the spirit tree, oaknock switches on the machine and reveals the true nature of argento. the king, furious at his duplicity, banishes glouphrie from the stronghold. according to rumours, glouphrie went on to create the city ofarposandraand shrouded it in mist. glouphrie creates an army of illusory giant tortoises. argento is killed. king healthorg dismisses glouphrie. hazelmere deduces that since the machine used elven magic, it must probably be operated by some sort of crystals. he hands you aviolet pentagonfor help in using the machine. go back to brimstail, and share with him all that you've learnt so far. as you are talking to him about crystal discs, asaboteurenters the dungeon and wrecks the machine. after the cut-scene, head to the broken-down machine and inspect it -""it looks like it was made with 2 types of wood and a glue that smells like a pine tree and held together with something sticky"". you need the following to repair it: grind themud runeto get someground mud runesand mix them with thebucket of sapto producemagic glue. use the glue on the machine or select the ""repair"" option on any of its components. to save time, talk to brimstail and get all the crystals from him by choosing ""i can't work out what to do with these discs!"" several times until he runs out of discs. the puzzle in the machine is different for every player. the machine will present a number on the front. this number corresponds to the value of crystal that must be inserted to unlock it. the following table lists the value of each crystal. the value of a crystal piece is the product of the ordinality of the colour in the rainbow and the number of sides the shape has. for example: there is an oaknock's exchanger on the right, which allows you to insert and exchange discs of equivalent value. you will always receive the same value back, in different discs. if you can't use or don't like the discs offered to you, you can press the double grey arrows again and you get a different combination of discs. for example, inserting a green square (16) into the exchanger can give you a blue triangle (15) and a red circle (1) as one of the many different combinations. to insert a shape, click on it from your inventory to make it appear in your hand, and then click on the coin slot icon. click the small green square to submit the crystal disc. the operating panel requires 6 separate discs adding up to 3 different numbers. the first one must be exactly equal to the value of the disc used. the second must be a combination of two discs, and the third, a combination of three discs. you can speak again to brimstail to receive more discs, as the original amount may not be sufficient to unlock and repair the machine. if brimstail will not give you additional disks, check your bank. it's possible you found some in your travels. if you intend to dothe path of glouphrieafterwards, keep the discs in your inventory as they are needed here as well. once you have unlocked the machine, the once""cute"" creaturestransform to""evil"" creatures, which leads you and brimstail to the conclusion that the creatures are spies and were responsible in the manipulation of the machine. brimstail tells you to inform king narnode of the espionage. kill the evil creature in brimstail's cave and talk to brimstail. deliver the news to the king, who believes you and requests you to kill all the remaining spies. there are six creatures in total, and they have only 1life pointeach: there is a possible glitch with the creature at the top of the tree where you kill it and climb down the ladder too quickly; you won't get credit for the kill. this is also possible if you re-enter the gnome stronghold too quickly. you can talk to king narnode to complete the quest despite this. finally, talk to king narnode again and obtain your reward. the eyes of glouphrie is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:    "

faced with a 6-foot tall gorse bush with a nasty temper ?[sic] do you suffer from growing pains ?[sic] to start the quest you must first talk tomartin the master gardenerin thedraynor villagesquare. he tells you about the rampant drop in crop yield all overrunescapeand wants your help to locate the source of this problem. you need to talk tofivemembers of the group of advanced gardeners (g. a. g.), besides martin (if you are not sure how many gardeners you have talked to, open up the quest guide and it will tell you if you have spoken to enough farmers). you can choose any of the gardeners near thefarming patches(allotments, bushes, hops, trees, etc.) aroundrunescape, excepthead farmer jonesat taverley. if you have a tree planted, you may need to clear it before the topic related to the quest will show up. the easiest gardeners to reach are the following: all of them say the same thing: they've been having trouble with poor crops. they all have different explanations of what they think is wrong, including lack of rain, insects, pesky adventurers and erratic seasons. however, the fifth one you ask will suggest the fairies are the common root of such reasons. if you ask more than five members, the additional ones will be unresponsive to the issue of crop failure. go back to draynor and talk to martin again. after telling him about the different ideas, go back to thelumbridge swampsand walk into the shack that was used duringlost citywith yourdramen staff(orlunar staff) to go tozanaris. head to the fairy queen's chamber. it's just south of where you enter the city, in the room with theslayer master. however, something's wrong. the queen herself is missing, and someone by the name offairy godfatheris there instead. when you speak to him, he will tell you that the queen protects the fairies from creatures known astanglefoot, who attack the city every once in a while from theshady grovenear thecosmic altar. unfortunately, in her last encounter with a tanglefoot, the queen has fallen to some sort of illness and is under the care offairy nuff. to find the queen, head west to the bank and then north to go to her house. talk to fairy nuff, and she will tell you the details of the queen's illness and give you asymptoms listto take to a wizard namedzandar horfyre, who used to work onotherworldly beingsin zanaris. go to falador and head west into the city, and climb across the crumbling portion of the wall to reach thedark wizards' tower. you can also teleport toport sarimand head north-west, or to theclan campand head a short distance north-west. when you arrive at the tower, head up to the top floor, and talk to zandar. if your combat level is low, you will be attacked by the level 22, 35, or 37dark wizardsin the same room as zandar. if this happens after handing over the list of symptoms to zandar and not finishing the conversation, you will have to return to fairy nuff to get another one. zandar explains to you that the life essence or the soul of fairies is purely magic. he tells you that a large part of the queen's life essence has been drained, which can only be done by a tanglefoot or be done voluntarily. he'll take the symptom list and then suggest you talk tomalignius mortifer, the only other known killer of a tanglefoot. malignius can be found south of falador, or north from the port sarim lodestone, along with four elemental wizards. talking to malignius at the um ritual site will not work. talk to him, and he'll tell you he could help but he wants something from you first – askullfromdraynor manor. no other skull will work, as malignius will not be fooled. go to the manor and around to the back. click on the gravestone to dig there to find the skull, and head back to malignius and give it to him. the toolbelt works, but if you need aspade, there is one on the east side of the manor. malignius tells you that he had indeed killed a tanglefoot a long time back using a pair ofmagic secateurs. to obtain them for yourself, malignius will tell you to go ask thenature spiritto perform the spell 'phasma phasmatis natura' on an ordinary pair of secateurs, along with three or four specific items. these are different for everyone, so youmustget the items assigned to you. you can find which items are needed by looking in your quest list. the requested items may include items from the list below. warning:ghastsinmort myreswamp may rot any food you carry. if one of your required items isedible seaweed,jangerberries,king wormsorlime, there is a chance that you may lose it; packdruid pouchesor multiple food items to be safe. you can also avoid most of the ghasts by walking along the walls ofcastle drakanand intomort'tonthrough its eastern entrance, from where you can safely get to thenature spirit. if you do not have the required herblore level to clean your herb, you can speak tozahurin nardah, who charges 200 coins for cleaning one herb. an alternative to this is to buy its clean version on the grand exchange. when you are finally ready, grab the required items, yoursecateurs, and go to themort myre swamp. make sure to have the secateurs in your backpack and not in your tool belt. walk south until you find the grotto tree on an island – marked by a summoning obelisk icon – and talk to the nature spirit. he will bless your secateurs, at which point they will start to glow green. it is a great idea to pray at the nature altar, as it boosts your prayer by 20 points and also rewards you with thefortified spiritachievement. thetanglefootcan only be harmed with the magic secateurs. the higher yourfarminglevel, the greater you will hit. head back to the lumbridge swamp and enter the shed with your dramen/lunar staff equipped. the magic secateurs are a one-handed weapon, so a shield or an off-hand weapon can be used, as long as themagic secateursare wielded, your off-hand weapon will do damage. head through the corridor south from the field of wheat to the mysterious ruins of thecosmic altar. to the west of the altar is an alcove with ashady grove. attempt to enter and thegatekeeperwill let you pass, saying that he is under orders to let you through. inside will be a bunch ofbaby tanglefootii, and at the end of the tunnel will be a large, level 68tanglefoot. wield yourmagic secateursand approach it. appropriate food and melee armour is recommended for lower-levelled players; shields are also recommended, as the defensive abilitiesreflectandrevengecan dramatically increase your damage output. since tanglefoot uses ranged attacks, it is suggested to useprotect from missiles. after you have defeated the tanglefoot, grab thequeen's secateursthat it drops. if you have a full inventory when you kill it or if you forget to pick up the secateurs and you leave, you can go back to the tunnel and receive them at the start of the tunnel. head back to the fairy godfather, and give them to him to finish the quest. a fairy tale i -

(for 1, 2 and 4 you can use the fairy ring autodialler to the locations mentioned in parentheses. destination 3 must be manually dialled.) if you end up on an island with somepenguins, you either made a mistake entering the codes (you cannot right click and immediately teleport to the next location, you must ""use"" the rings each time and teleport back to zanaris, then enter the next location), are not holding the certificate, did not complete the step of finding the plaque at the ruins (see previous paragraph), or you do not have the required levels to continue with the quest. you should be in the fairy queen'snew location. just go up the path, and head to the north-eastern room. talk to fairy nuff who, along withfairy very wise, informs you that the queen is not well because the godfather has hurt her by not returning her magic secateurs. as her essence is drained, she cannot retaliate without obtaining the secateurs, which you accept to bring back. head back to zanaris, now filled withorks, and pickpocket the fairy godfather. if you fail, you will be teleported outside zanaris, so try pickpocketing from behind or the side, and make sure neither of his henchmen are looking directly at you. you should get a goldenqueen's secateurs. you won't be able to travel back to the hideout by usingajs, but the steps will be saved in your travel log. therefore, if you've kept nuff's certificate with you, you may simply select ""fairy resistance hq"" from the travel log and press ""teleport"" to take you there, without having to travel to all the other three locations again. if you bank nuff's certificate, the travel log will make you go through all the steps again. the travel log might also be reset by using the fairy rings to other locations, by logging out or simply over time. the good thing is if you have travelled to the hideout once, you will have the record near the bottom of the log and can use that for travelling to each step. as you complete steps, the highlighted code in the hideout sequence will show you where you will go next. back at the fairy hideout, talk to fairy nuff and give her the secateurs. she will use them to rejuvenate the queen, but they do not work completely. nuff tells you that she needs a certainmagic essence potionto replenish the queen's missing life energy. to make the potion, you need to collect some starflowers and crushed gorak claw. the potion must be created when fairy nuff prompts you to, as any potion created beforehand will not work. return to the fairy ring in zanaris and use the codeckp, which transports you to acosmic entity plane. move around for about 2 minutes whilst thestar flowersgrow. you can pass the time by talking to thecosmic beingwho lives there, contemplating the mysteries of the universe. when it's ready, pick a starflower and add your harvest to the vial of water. return to zanaris, and withdraw any armour and weapons, along with around 10 pieces of good food. protection prayers do not work against goraks as their attacks deal typeless damage, but you may use boosting prayers as necessary to help you kill them. at the zanaris fairy ring, use the sequencedirto get to another plane full ofgoraks. they are level 74 and are capable of lowering your stats on successful hits.super restoresare helpful for lower levels. their attack's accuracy is rolled against your melee defence, meaning magic armour will provide the best defence. they are also weak against magic attacks, and can be killed fairly quickly with a level 60 or higher weapon and a suitablewater spell(water blastor higher). however, melee can also be used effectively with at least level 70 equipment. thegorak clawsare not a 100% drop, so you may have to kill multiple goraks until you receive them. when you obtain the claws, grind them with a pestle and mortar to get somegorak claw powder. mix the starflower and crushed claw into a vial of water to make amagic essencepotion. back at the hideout, first talk to fairy nuff, informing her that you have made the potion. fairy nuff asks you to give the potion to the fairy queen. use a dose of the magic essence potion on the queen, who finally regains her senses. as the queen angrily prepares to return to zanaris and take back her throne, fairy very wise and fairy nuff remind her that the godfather has thugs and orks at his disposal, compared to her small band of loyalists, many of whom are injured. her majesty sees the flaw in the plan, and accepts the advice. the fairy godfather will continue to rule zanaris — for now. talk to the queen to end the quest. a fairy tale ii - cure a queen is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

(the level 85 firemaking requirement cannot be boosted.) if you broughtplanksandnails, take a moment to fix the bridge by using a plank on the broken part of the bridge. the bridge also has to be repaired from the mos le'harmless side in order to completely connect this island to the mainland. note: if the fairy resistance hq was the last location you travelled to using the fairy rings, the coordinates given to you by fairy fixit will likely take you back to the hq. if this is the case, travel to any alternative fairy ring before attempting to travel to k'chunk. gromblodcan be found at theenchanted valley, looking for food there. go there using the fairy ring codebkq. talk to gromblod, but he will not tell you much. a few steps away, talk to thewood dryador acentaur. you'll be told that they want gromblod out of there. talk to gromblod again to find out that he is looking for amango(amangoobtained from farming does not work). talk to the wood dryad and ask where you can find a mango. she tells you that there are no mangoes in the valley; you'll need to use a fairy ring to find one. you're directed to use the fairy codeclr, which will take you toape atoll(it is safe unless you attack themonkey archersand you do not need agreegree). she will also enchant you so you can access the ring. go to ape atoll using your newly acquired fairy ring code, and pick a mango from the tree, which is located right next to the fairy ring. optionally you can unblock the log nearby. return to the enchanted valley (bkq) and give the mango to gromblod. after trying to eat the mango, gromblod's tooth will become stuck in the mango and he will throw it away. pick up themango with toothdirectly south of gromblod. use thetooth extractoron the mango to retrievegromblod's tooth. shredfleshcan be found inhis cavelocated in west ofgu'tanoth; you must use the fairy ring codealpto teleport into it directly first. talk to shredflesh there and ask 'can i help with something?' after that, ask the first three questions about his pain, then say that you're a dentist. a mood bar should pop-up. use the correct dialogue options that convince him to let you pull his tooth. as soon as this bar is filled, the ork will allow you to pull his teeth. use thetooth extractoron shredflesh. the screen is again censored for the squeamish. you will obtainshredflesh's tooth. optionally, clear the pile of rock behind him to gain access to the cave from the surface world via a discreet cave entrance just south of the zogre area in jiggig (your tool belt pickaxe will work). retrieve your combat equipment and food from the bank on your way back to the fairy resistance hq (air,dlr,djq,ajs) and talk to thetooth fairy, who will explain the rest of the plan to you and tell you to turn on the projector for yet another briefing. she explains that only the orkivory statuescan disable the godfather's shields, and tells you to go to theork's riftusing thefairy rings, by dialing the combination of codesbir,dip,clr,alpafter each other. (note that if you did not accept fairy very wise's offer at the beginning of the quest, the trip to the fairy ring atbiris one-way; you will need to teleport out and travel to any other fairy ring to dial the next coordinate.) she will also give you herfairy wandto heal the statues there. it can be equipped and used as adramen stafforlunar staffto activate the fairy rings. however, magic combat with it is inadvisable as it is a tier 1 weapon. exit the hq and activate the fairy ring. at ork's rift, thefairy mafiaare preparing for their invasion near some conveniently located enchanted patches. look through the fairy tree to view a cutscene. the tooth fairy will reappear and remind you to defeat the generals first while growing the ivory orks, and once they are grown thefairy godfathercan be damaged. you can now squeeze through the fairy tree and dispatch them once and for all; the generals (shredflesh,bre'egth, andgromblod) are level 85, theork warriorsare level 79, and the fairy godfather himself is level 84. if you die during this final battle, yourgravestonewill be at the mainfairy ringinzanaris, although the quest items will be lost and have to be retrieved from the tooth fairy. squeeze through the line of fairy trees to begin the battle. you can teleport out any time, but progress would be lost. the godfather will be invulnerable at first. you must grow teeth in the farming patches and protect them from general shredflesh while avoiding the godfathers's spells. you can track the progress of their growth by examining the individual patches; the growth stages are small, medium, and large and the ivory orks will spawn on their own when they have finished growing. the ivory orks will gradually take down his shields and once they are down, the godfather will finally become vulnerable to damage, and the fight will end as soon as his life points are depleted to zero. the godfather has the following abilities, which will be accompanied by a phrase he shouts. each general also has a special role, and killing them provides a certain advantage: the godfather's standard magical attack the godfather's freezing spell the godfather's healing spell before you enter the arena (the tooth fairy will give you one last briefing before you go through), make sure you have protect/deflect from magic activated and sufficient prayer points. after you begin the fight, immediately run to the farming patches and plant the teeth. while you wait for the teeth to grow (takes about 2 minutes and 15 seconds), kill general shredflesh, to prevent him from causing the patches to become diseased. after killing him you can exit through the line of trees and hide in the entrance area with the fairy ring while you wait for them to grow (if you leave entirely, the teeth will be lost and the tooth fairy will give them back to you when you go in again). it might be possible to let your ivory orks do all the work while you stand outside in the entrance area, although it takes some time and requires the damage to be higher than the healing (you might need to take down some generals first). the generals should be killed in the following order: do not fight the ork warriors while gromblod is alive, as he will simply summon more. they can deal quite a bit of melee damage, so you can get them stuck behind a general or in a line so limit the attacks you receive. the ivory orks prioritise fighting against the general they are made from, and then other orks, and they are quite weak and inaccurate so they must be killed before they would focus on fairy godfather. they would regrow (taking the same amount of time) on their own in their patch if killed. they must take down all 3 of his shields before you can damage him - this can take several minutes. all 3 ivory orks are required. during this time, the godfather will constantly use his fish attack on all 3 of them at once. while you can heal them with the fairy wand wielded, for 10-50 life points each time (59 magic required), it is tedious and not recommended, as they are weak and take damage rapidly, and you won't be able to keep up with fairy godfather's damage (they might only take down 1 shield during one lifespan, making you wait for them to regrow again twice to take down the other 2 shields). instead, attack him yourself - while he takes no damage, this would make him turn his attention to you, but he would rarely attack at all. once the godfather's shield is depleted, he will become vulnerable, and you will finally be able to damage him. he's fairly weak, so you shouldn't have much trouble. after defeating the godfather, talk to him to start a cutscene. the fairy queen and twofairy stitchersappear, and incredulous at his defeat, the godfather curses the ivory orks, corrupting them and causing them to collapse. the rift sucks in the godfather, and the fairies attempt to stitch up the rift. the godfather's evil overloads it and causes it to explode and the cursed ivory orks reemerge from the patches, and the tooth fairy teleports you back to headquarters. talk with the fairy queen, she unlocks the ability to travel through fairy rings without a staff, and offers to teleport you to martin the master gardener in draynor village, so you can talk with him. congratulations, quest complete! a fairy tale iii - battle at ork's rift is not currently required for any quests or miniquests. the tooth fairy is injured. afairy doctorheals her. the godfather summons a shield that will protect him. the protection anchors itself on the orks. the rift where orks are summoned from."

so choose carefully! these are not required if you obtain the items required as a drop instead. to start, speak withdimintheis, whose house is in the fenced-off area in the south-eastern section ofvarrock. he'll tell you that he belongs to the noble family of fitzharmon, but without his family's crest, he can't prove his heritage and take back his estate from the king. his sons took the crest when they left to defend varrock against the hordes of zombies sent forth by anevil necromancer, and he doesn't know what happened to them afterwards. he has, however, heard rumours that his eldest son,caleb, is now an aspiring fish chef and is currently staying with a friend just outside the western gates of varrock. calebcan be found bygertrude's house, located just outside the western entrance of varrock. talk to him, and he'll say that he and his brothers broke the crest into threepartsto avoid any one of them inheriting their father's wealth. in their shame, they took a piece of the crest each and set out their own ways, unable to face their father. since a broken crest is of no use to anyone, he agrees to exchange it for some fish that he needs for a special and unique salad he is currently making. what you need is a shrimp, salmon, tuna, bass, and swordfish — all cooked. if you need to catch the fish yourself (which requires level 50 fishing and 45 cooking): once you have all of it, give the cooked fish to caleb and he'll give you thecrest partas promised. ask caleb about the other pieces, and he will tell you the whereabouts of one of his other brothers,avan(don't forget or avan wont speak to you).  head to theal kharid mineand talk toavan, the man with a yellow cape wandering around the pit entrance. he tells you that he is trying to win the affection of a certain lady by gifting her a ruby-studded ring and necklace made out of 'perfect' gold. you can mineuncut rubyfrom theuncommon gem rockat the north end of the mine and cut them (requires 20 mining and 34 crafting). unfortunately, the gold here in the desert isn't nearly good enough for him. he'll tell you about adwarfnamedboot, who might know the whereabouts of this 'perfect' gold. make your way to thedwarven minesbelow theice mountain, a short distance northeast from thefaladorlodestone. boot can be found in a cavern to the south-west of thedwarven shopping store; talk to him and ask him about the elusive gold. he'll tell you that the highest quality of gold can be found in a small dungeon nearwitchaven, although it isn't really easy to get to it. make sure to get good food and armour before heading into thewitchaven dungeon, as there are monsters that may harm lower-levelled players (level 35hobgoblins, level 67ogresand level 92hellhounds). home teleport to ardougne and head east then south to an ""old ruin entrance"", and climb down it. keep following the path and then head south to a locked door to the east that leads to a room that holds a couple of hellhounds, along with the'perfect' gold rocks. to the north and south are two rooms with levers in and outside of them – you'll have to do a lever puzzle to unlock the gate to the caged area. remember that if you logout while doing the puzzle you will have to start over: mine two gold ores in the room and head to any furnace to smelt them intoperfect gold bars– there's one just west of theal kharid lodestone. next, make theperfect ringandperfect necklaceby using the perfect gold bar on the furnace with two rubies in your inventory. once you have the items, head back to the al kharid mine and give them to avan. as a reward, he'll give you thesecond piece of the crestand tell you where to find the final brother,johnathon. the last brother —johnathon— is staying in thejolly boar inn, nearfort forinthry. he is upstairs in one of the bedrooms. climb up the stairs to talk to him (you might have to speak to him twice); he'll tell you that he got bit by apoison spider. use the antipoison on him, and he'll be very grateful and relate to you about what happened. apparently, johnathon attempted to kill a blood demon calledchronozon. unfortunately, chronozon defeated him, and in his efforts to escape, he was bitten by the poisonous spider. when you ask him for the third part of the crest, he says that he dropped it while fighting chronozon and that you must go retrieve it. chronozon is located in theedgeville dungeon, which is in the ruined building just south of the bank. climb down into the dungeon and keep going north along that path, taking a left at the farthest corner. you may make use of the safespot in the north-west side of the cave, behind the space between the stalagmite and the torch. you may have to kill the aggressivepoison spiders, but they can't attack you once you are in position. you must use each ofair,water,earth, andfire blastto defeat chronozon. they can be auto-casted, and abilities work. the blast spells must damage the demon, therefore bringing extra runes is advised due to the possibility of a spell splashing. anelemental battlestaff, or air runes and amindspiketo change the element can be used to save on elemental runes. you can also use adeathtouched dartto defeat chronozon without casting any of the spells. you must continue to attack using the blast spell until you receive the message ""... blast seems to have done all it will to chronozon"", at which point you must switch to another blast spell. after you cast the blast spells successfully, you can fight chronozon however you like. if you leave the area or logout during the fight, chronozon will be restored to full health and you will have to recast the spells, even if you had already weakened him. once you've killed him, he will drop thecrest part. simply grab it and leave. now that you have all three crest pieces, put them together by using any one part with another to make thefamily crestand then make your way back to varrock. give the crest todimintheis, who will be very pleased to have it back. congratulations, quest complete! family crest is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

requirement, completion ofritual of the mahjarratandthe world wakesis strongly recommended in order to fully appreciate the quest's storyline, and completion of themahjarrat memoriesminiquest also gives anengrammeterthat can be used to reduce damage while on freneskae, in addition to providing further information on zaros. speak toazzanadra, south of theeagle's peaklodestoneand north-west of the gates toarandar pass, who will inform you that the death ofguthixhas allowed all of the gods to return, but there is one final obstacle preventing the return ofzaros, which you can help remove. accept the quest. upon speaking to azzanadra again, he will explain that the world gate was created by guthix long ago, and is the only portal that can reach every plane in existence, although it is currently limited to those worlds that guthix or zaros visited with it. he will tell you that he, together with zaros, has enlisted the help ofslisketo pull the world gate out of theshadow realm. sliske will appear and pull you into the shadow realm to offer you a proposal before telling you how to fix the world gate. sliske will say that his mastery of the shadow realm has grown, and explain how you may be able to achieve a big win (depending on yourgod emissariesalignment). since you will be the only one able to pass through the world gate and meet zaros, the fate of zaros will be in your hands. sliske will claim to be still loyal to zaros, after a fashion. a combination lock on the gate will need to be removed before it can be used. sliske will place the combination on a pillar, which you should investigate to get the symbols. then click on the control consoles in front of the gate. the left console will rotate the symbols to the left, and the right console will rotate them to the right. you'll have to rotate the symbols in the noted direction to each symbol, like a combination lock, so that they spell outm-a-hin the runic alphabet. when a correct world of the combination is switched to, an animation occurs alerting you to this fact. heading in the wrong direction once you've got the correct world will de-power the world gate, forcing you to start again. this can be done before the quest, and if you have, you will not need to do it again. to power up theworld gate, you must use the following combination in the following order: after the world gate has been activated and sliske has returned it to the material realm, azzanadra will tell you that he has set the gate so that it will only take you to the right location until zaros is returned. enter the gate once you have made necessary preparations. a decent amount of food, aface mask(or an item that acts as one), and abeast of burdenare highly recommended. when onfreneskae, you will need to move quickly. the air is filled with smoke and will make you choke, causing 50 life points worth of damage every 15 seconds (negated if wearing aface maskor equivalent protection). lightning may also strike at any time, preceded by a flickering light on the ground. if you are hit by a lightning strike you will be damaged for 1500 life points; being near a lightning strike will cause you 750 life points of damage. volcanic vents will spew hot steam and will spill lava if you step on them. this causes 400 life points of damage. balls of lava will drop from the sky, damaging you for 500 life points; being near an impact will cause you 250 life points of damage. walls also leak lava onto passers-by. if you are hit by the lava you will be damaged for 1000 life points; being near the wall will cause you 500 life points of damage. there will also be safe spots, where you get healed. these are under arches, with glowing purple crystals, and a dark purple ball before the first time you enter them. memoriam crystalscan be found throughout freneskae. the crystals can be deposited in the sanctum to unlock memories, which will reveal a part of the past. collecting the crystals is not required to complete the quest, although they provide information which may help you decide whether or not to ultimately help zaros. finding all of the memoriam crystals is also required for the master quest cape achievementszarosian memoriesandseren memories, although some can only be found after the quest has been completed.some skippable instructions will be in italics. each section of freneskae is a checkpoint and you can return there from the world gate after you reach it the first time. you should have at least 9 free inventory spaces if you plan to collect the crystals without having to bank before the first checkpoint. once through the world gate, you will arrive in an area named the approach, the most dangerous and largest area of freneskae. although you will initially get the feeling that you are being watched, you will quickly dismiss it. once you enter the cave at the end of the approach, you will enter the sanctum, the area where zaros contacted azzanadra in thetemple at senntisten. unlike the approach, this area is completely safe, however it does not have a healing effect. in the north-west corner ismemoriam crystal z11, and the memoriam device in the middle of the room is where you can deposit the crystals you have with you and view all of the memories that you have collected so far. thezarosian memoriesthat you have collected so far are monologues spoken by zaros himself, sharing information about topics such as his own birth by theelder godmah, his departure from his home world and exploration of other planes, and his various experiments including the creation of his general,nex. at the other end of the room is a door with symbols on it. the door is locked, and to open it, a relatively simple puzzle must be solved. there are three stages to this puzzle, with the last being the hardest. to solve the puzzle, you must rotate the panels on the door to match the symbols on them to light up the lines which are in-between the dials. once all of the lines are lit up, the next stage will begin. after completing all three stages of this puzzle, you will be able to proceed. now is the time to bank if needed, as four nihil must be killed in the next part. you will now be able to return to the puzzle room from the world gate. enter the next room and stand at the centre of it, where the mysterious entity will be found. four different creatures known asnihilwill then emerge from the tunnels around the edge of the room. each nihil is based on one of the elements fromancient magicksand one of the races ofgielinor. if you try to exit or continue, the doors will lock shut, so you will have to fight the nihil to unlock the doors. if you die or escape from the pit, all four nihils will be restored to full health. this room stays cleared when all nihils are defeated and the character will have a message about their defeat. if you die during this fight, you will end up in death's office and will need to reclaim your items, and go back to the world gate, just south of the eagles peak lodestone. the nihil emerge at random from the twelve doorways and will charge in one direction. making contact with one of them while they are running will cause 25% of the player's maximum health in damage, as well as a side effect based on the nihil that hit you. each nihil always runs in the same direction: theice nihilruns south, thesmoke nihilruns west, theshadow nihilruns north, and theblood nihilruns east. therefore, a pair of nihil (ice and shadow or smoke and blood) can be killed, leaving areas between the tracks unused and safe. lower levelled players can also use this to rest and heal between fights. each nihil uses a different combat style, but has no weaknesses, and has a special attack (which is signalled by it hissing beforehand) as follows: the nihil can deal significant damage even through prayer, so prayer points, stats, and health should be monitored closely.super restoresare very useful to counter the stat-reducing effects. once the nihil are dead, continue north to the now unlocked door, retrievememoriam crystal z10and then enter the doors and climb the cliffside. you will emerge atop the volcano, next to a large sleeping figure. this is currently blockingmemoriam crystal z03, and you can retrieve it after completing the quest. approach the figure and attempt to climb down the cliff next to its left hand (your right, its left), and the mysterious entity will once again appear, telling you to stop, and revealing itself to be none other than zaros himself. zaros will explain that the sleeping figure ismah, anelder god, and that he has been guiding you through freneskae. he will also tell you that his and your presence is making mah awaken from her slumber, and takes you to a place where you and he can speak more easily: your mind threshold. here, he explains that he needs you to make him a body from mah's energy in an area called the elder halls beneath the volcano, and allows you to ask questions about his plans, origins, and thoughts on people. through this, he reveals he is the creation of mah, and that an event known as the ""great revision"" is coming, which he aims to ascend to elder godhood in order to stop. after you have finished asking zaros questions, tell him that you are ready, and he will explain that when you wake up, you will have to defend against mah's nightmares until it subsides, allowing you to go and make him a body. zaros will offer to stay in your body in order to help you fight the nightmares. you have the option to refuse him, but if you accept his offer to stay in your body to help you fight the nightmares, then you will receive unlimited prayer points and runes while using theancient cursesandancient magicks, respectively. you will then awaken back at the volcano. to start the nightmare, approach mah. the nightmare will last a couple of minutes, and you must defend againstmuspahs. your progress is displayed at the top of your screen in order to help you keep track of how long you have got left. prayer and food are especially useful in this part, and abeast of burdenis highly recommended. if you agreed to let zaros into your mind, he will give you unlimited prayer points for ancient curses and unlimited runes for ancient magicks, as well as reduce a small part of the damage from the muspahs. if you refused to let him enter you, or if you die, by talking to him you can let him in again. at the start of the fight, one muspah at a time is spawned. as the nightmare runs its course, more muspahs begin to spawn, to a maximum of five in the last moments of mah's nightmare. mah will occasionally clench her hands, followed by a scream shortly after. once mah screams, the player will be stunned and dealt 20% of their maximum life points, while muspahs will take up to 9,200 damage. the stun can be prevented with the use ofanticipationorfreedom, but the damage received can not be prevented. once the progress bar hits 0%, all of the muspah will die and you are free to climb down the summit into the elder halls. if, by bad luck, a player reaches 0% on the progress bar and runs out of life points at the same time, the player may still complete the battle if the player receives a message in their chat box saying they succeeded. zaros will once again explain that he needs you to make a body from themah wispsand specifies that he needs you to make adark simulacrumin order to aid his return and that alight simulacrumwould reject his essence. zaros will also once again offer to enter your body in order to assist you and offer advice, but this is once again optional, and this time, doing so gives no gameplay advantage although it does restore your prayer points and provides some extra dialogue. if you die during the fight your gravestone will appear outside of the world gate. you will be allowed to reenter the world gate to a checkpoint right before starting the fight with the muspah. climb down the ledge at the opposite end to where you entered, next to mah's hand. you will enter a large area with severalmah wisps, the elder halls of this world. pick upthe measure, anelder artefactcreated to measure anima, from the nearby ground. this artefact causes faint mah wisps to become visible, allowing you to siphon them formah energyandmah memories, the latter of which can be converted to energy at the crater in the middle of the halls. you need to physically place the measure down near faint wisps to turn them into mah wisps before attempting to siphon. mah wisps can be found all over the halls, spawning both in the centre and at the ends of the tunnels where curious ""eggs"" can be found. it seems as if the five ""eggs"" each represent one of the five elder gods, which explains why one of the eggs looks similar to the stone of jas, and that another one of them is explained by zaros to be ""mah's"". once you obtain 250 mah energy, you must weave a simulacrum from it, either a dark simulacrum if you wish to aid zaros, or a light simulacrum if you wish to hinder him. once you are done, head down the southeastern path to retrievememoriam crystal z12, then climb back up to the summit and return to zaros. he will be pleased to accept a dark simulacrum or be extremely disappointed if you chose to give him a light one, but forced to accept it nevertheless. bear in mind that whichever simulacrum you chose will change his appearance, so carefully consider your choice. exit the rock face to the west to head to zaros. after you have given him your simulacrum, zaros will form and outfit his new body, before mah awakens, causing zaros to teleport you and himself away back to theworld gateat the entrance to freneskae. before you leave, zaros will have a little chat with you, questioning you about how you feel about the choice you made. once you are done discussing it with him, head back through the world gate. zaros shapes the divine simulacrum in his image zaros continues to form his new body zaros garbs his new body with robes and armour mah awakens and zaros teleports you away mah is angered the wound in zaros's chest if you give him a light simulacrum step through the world gate and return toazzanadrato witness the return of zaros. azzanadra will summoncharandnex, and you will be back in your mind threshold. aware of sliske's betrayal due to your memories, and no longer able to condone his methods, zaros proceeds to excommunicate him, telling him that he will have no further association with the zarosians. this angers sliske, causing him to state that zaros's protection will no longer apply to you as far he's concerned, and teleports away. zaros will then task his followers with various assignments: he tasks char with keeping an eye on sliske, fearing he may do something rash due to being hurt, nex with keeping sliske's god contest in check, and charges azzanadra with locating theelder hallsin gielinor, so that he may prepare to rouse the elder gods and prevent them from destroying the universe. if you hindered him, he also charges azzanadra with finding a way to extend the lifespan of his body. if you helped him, he charges you with dealing with the threat of thedragonkin. finally, regardless of your decision, zaros will reward you with a variety of things, including ashardof crystal from his arm, which will affiliate you with zaros and allow you to communicate with him via the device in the sanctum, and the quest will finish. congratulations, quest complete!

anarchic place, south of the shantay pass. talk toali morrisanein theal kharidbazaar north of the al kharid lodestone – look for the quest () sign. when talking to him ask him ""if you are, then why are you still selling goods from a stall?"" to start the quest. he needs you to go and find his nephew, 'ali', who lives in a small town south-east of al kharid calledpollnivneach. buy thekharidian headpieceandfake beardand use them on each other to get adesert disguise. be sure to have somewaterskinsand then head to the little village of southpollnivneach. you can either walk, travel by magic

tojalal the drunk. he wants beer, in return for information. use beers on him, one at a time and he will reveal a bit of information at a time. after giving him the three beers, he will tell you that ali morrisane's nephew was involved with themenaphitesandbanditgangs. alternatively, you can speak to one of the street urchins wandering the town to get the same information. head west of the bar and talk to anymenaphite thug. when you ask them a few questions, you learn that the gangs are feuding with each other over a stolen camel. the menaphites will tell you that the only way of ending the feud is if the bandits give them back the camel. talk to any bandit in the northern part of the city, for the other view of the same tale. you need to talk to both groups before you can continue. don't try to go to the bandit camp because none of those bandits will talk to you. go to the discount camel store, which is located north-west of the bar. asksami the camel manfor two camels. offer him 500 coins, and you will receive twocamel receipts. give the receipts to each gang, one to any bandit in the north part of town and the other to the menaphite thug in the south/west part of town. now you must join one of the gangs. go and talk torashid the operator, who can be found around the large menaphite purple-gold tent in the south west of town. your first task is to pickpocket 3 villagers. the 3 villagers have to be looted in three different ways and you will need to return to rashid for advice between each pickpocketing: now rashid wants you to steal the mayor's wife'sjewelsfrom the safe in their villa. he will give you thekeysto the front door of the villa. now, put on yourdesert disguise(if you do not have the materials, the market seller in the northern part of the town sells them). only certain types of ""gloves"" will allow you to case the villa. some that work are:leather gloves,coloured gloves,zombie gloves,karamja gloves,ice gloves,carapace gloves, etc. gauntlets will not work unless they are metal. vambraces,batwing gloves,tracking gloves, andspider silk glovesall do not work. the villa is located just north-east of the bar, or directly east of the discount camel store. there is a fountain in the courtyard of the villa to make it easy to find. hide behind the huge cactus outside the mayor's villa by clicking on it. after spying around the house (note, you literally need to run in a circle around the villa, at least once, to unlock the door by using your key on it), you see that the villa is empty and it is safe to go in. use your key on the door to get inside. search the study desk, and you will find a note with a riddle and several numbers written on it. go up the staircase and search the bed. you will find another note with ""fibonacci"" written on it. then, search the landscape picture hanging beside the bed and you discover the safe. you must click 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, on the dial, which is the famousfibonacci sequence. the dial is set to 0. the numbers progress from 1-9 (clockwise). once the combination is entered, the safe will open and you can take the jewels. note: if you have no inventory space, you will have to enter this sequence again. give the jewels torashid the operatorand he gives you your final task: find the traitor in the menaphites. talk to any menaphite gang member and they will say that ""it must betraitorous hesham"". go back to rashid the operator and he will tell you to finish off the traitor. go back to the bar and speak with the barman to find out that the beer on the table belongs to the traitor. go north-west of the kebab shop, upon the hill tomaysa the hag. she can make apoisonfor you, if you can get her some snake venom and camel dung. go back and give the snake basket and the ugthanki dung to maysa the hag, and she'll exchange it for a bottle of poison (you may have to speak with her a second time to hand over the dung and receive the vial). go to the pub once more and use the poison with the beer on the table (the beer mug will turn green momentarily), and go back to rashid the operator. now that you have completed rashid's three tasks, he trusts you and tells you to talk to his leader (who magically appears outside the tent). after talking to themenaphite leader, you decide to kill him as he is a follower ofamascut, who is just a little crazy with world domination schemes! a level 54tough guyarrives to fight you. he can be safe spotted from the camel pen. kill him and he will drop awillow-blackjack. seeing this, the menaphite leader will run away, vowing to come back for revenge. talk to a villager, and instead of being happy about the resolved feud, they are angry with you for upsetting the balance of power and that you need to deal with thebandit leadertoo. he can be found just east of the northernmagic carpet. talk to the bandit leader and you will tell him to the leave town, ""or else"". the bandit leader tries to argue, saying that the villagers will never acknowledge your acts, but you are adamant about him leaving. he will not leave without a fight, so he summons his level 54bandit champion. he can be safe spotted within the house to the right. when you are done, talk to any villager again. the bandit leader was right, they are still ungrateful! go talk tohakeem the mayor, who is a little more respectful. he can be found walking around the centre of the town. he will tell you about the whereabouts of ali morrisane's nephew. return to al kharid and speak toali morrisane, where you surmise that ali and his nephew are too similar to be different people and attempt to understand what he was trying to sell to you and why. he then suggests that it was a ploy to promote tourism, and you admit that he is indeed a skilled salesman. he will then give a reward after selling you some more merchandise. the feud is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

head back to sammy and use the cell keys on his prison door to free him. sammy tells you that he overheard a guard saying they took his dad into the main arena, and so the pair of you head there in search of him. after entering the arena, a level 64khazard ogreis released from its prison, and he will proceed to attack justin before heading towards you. if you die at any point during the quest, you can resume from the fight you died at by talking to the one of the khazard guards at the entrances to the prison arena. thekhazard ogrehas a combat level of 64, and attacks with melee. he is fairly weak, being even weaker than a standardogre. magic is the advised attack style, as he is weak toair spells, and you can safespot him by luring him behind one of the skeletons in the arena, which will make the fight extremely easy. alternatively, you can alsorangehim from the safespot, or if you are suitably high levelled, melee him and turn onprotect from melee, which will halve all damage. after you defeat the ogre, justin servil will thank for you saving his life, and claims that he is in your debt. however,general khazardwill then appear and introduce himself, saying that the fight rather entertained him, but that the prisoners you just ""saved"" are his property. say that they belong to nobody, and he replies that he will let them go, but on one condition: you must stay and fight for him, becoming his new fight slave, as you will make him double the gold if you manage to last a few fights. he calls the guards, and they take you prisoner, locking you inside a cell and taking your cell keys. you are locked inside a prison cell. talk tohengrad, your cellmate, and ask him how he is, and he will tell you that he's been one of khazard's prisoners since he was a child, most of his life spent fighting in the hope he may one day escape. tell him not to give up, and one of khazard's guards comes to escort you back into the arena. as you enter, a level 50khazard scorpionwill be released from its cell. unlike the other bosses in this quest, the khazard scorpion attacks with ranged, and thus cannot be safespotted. it is weak tocrushattacks, so a crush weapon is advised, and, as it uses ranged, melee armour and theprotect from rangedprayer may help significantly. the scorpion is still relatively easy, and most high level players should have no problem with it. general khazard, impressed with your combat ability, sees that you need a tougher challenge, and so he releases his ""puppy"", a levelhellhoundnamedbouncer. bouncer, like the ogre, is weaker than other hellhounds and attacks withmelee. unlike the ogre and scorpion however, bouncer has no defined weakness, but magic attacks are nevertheless most effective against him. as bouncer uses melee, like the ogre, he can also be trapped behind one of the skeletons in the arena and safespotted from afar. alternatively, most players should have no trouble meleeing him, with the protect from melee prayer making it significantly easier. once bouncer is defeated,general khazardbecomes angered at his dog being killed, and claims that you will suffer for it. say that he agreed to let the servils go, and he remarks that he will let them, stating that he is not cowardly enough to make false promises. however, as you have caused him so much trouble today, you will remain in his arena so that he has the pleasure of killing you himself. sammy and justin leave the arena, telling you to come with them. general khazard attacks you. general khazard is an optional fight, so you may simply teleport out of the arena or leave via the door if you do not wish to fight him. you will still be able to complete the quest by talking to lady servil. general khazard has a combat level of , and like the ogre and bouncer, attacks with melee. like bouncer, he is listed as having no weakness, but magic attacks are nevertheless more accurate than other styles, with ranged attacks being the least accurate. even though he is amahjarrat, he is fairly weak, and can be killed with melee with relative ease or simply lured behind a skeleton and safespotted with magic or ranged. once general khazard is reduced to zero life points, you both head towards the entrance of the arena, and he proclaims that he cannot be beaten, and to ""behold the power of the mahjarrat"". he turns into a giant version of himself, calls you a ""puny human"" and once again proceeds to attack you. in his giant form, he has 6000 life points, a combat level of 84, and is slightly stronger. he still attacks with exactly the same method however, and should prove no challenge if you managed to kill him in his first form. once khazard reaches zero life points for the second time, he screams ""noooooooooooooo!"" and shrinks, seemingly disappearing. leave the arena. head back to lady servil, who is still found west of the ardougne monastery. she is surprised that you are alive, as she thought khazard had defeated you, and expresses her thanks that her son and husband are safe and sound, as without you they would certainly be dead. she will then proceed to reward you, as she promised earlier. congratulations, quest complete! fight arena is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: the quest was released on 23 july 2002, the same day as two other members quests,holy grailandtree gnome village. it was developed bypaul gower, andian gowerwas responsible for converting the quest intorunescape 2.[1]a description of the quest was also released in thegame guide: can you rescue the servils before the tyrant has these innocent (not to mention wealthy) civilians slain? the quest was reworked on27 may2009[3], which, among other changes, added a second form to general khazard, graphically updated him to look likezemouregalandlucien, and replaced the attackable guard that wandered around the prisoner, who needed the khali brew, with the stationarylazy khazard guard. with the release ofritual of the mahjarraton14 september2011, some dialogue was adjusted in various mahjarrat quests, which included fight arena. the most notable changes in fight arena are that lady servil no longer refers to having declined general khazard's hand in marriage, and that the khazard guards no longer refer to general khazard as having died over 200 years ago, with his spirit currently remaining in the form of an ""undead maniac""."

instead of dying, you are always rescued when your health reaches 0, but you still have to redo the room. items with high healing abilities are best. players should use the highest-healing food they can. healing familiars can also help in the final battle. having a familiar out in the puzzle-solving rooms can make the puzzle harder to solve, as the familiar will often stand in a place where you want to be. this is because left-clicking there causes you to interact with the familiar instead of moving, wasting valuable time. it is recommended that you use the hide familiar setting if you have a familiar during the puzzle portions of the quest. for most players, it is likely that you will have to leave the cave several times to resupply, so one option is to bring the healing familiar only when you gear up for the final battle with char. for the final battle, players will need a fast weapon. fast melee weapons work quite effectively against char as long as a sufficient number of fires are lit. dual-wielding is recommended. the damage dealt is not determined by the weapon, but accuracy, so use the most accurate weapon available. to start this quest, travel to the starting location south ofeagles' peakand talk tophoenix. the fastest way to travel there is using the eagles' peak lodestone, then running directly south. he is south-west of the terrorbird pens in the tree gnome stronghold. you can also use theeagle transport systemto travel to eagles' peak, then run south to the start location. usingardougne teleportwould also be relatively quick, as a player would need to run north and west to reach the starting location. you could also use a phoenix lair teleport scroll. another method would be to use the fairy ring teleportakqtopiscatoris hunter areaand run south. once you arrive, talk to any of the firemakers to begin the quest. a cut-scene will ensue where you will be introduced toemmett,flint,isis,lina,phoenix,sera, andtwig. they will explain to you their desire to find long-lostfiremakingknowledge—which came to them in a dream—in the caves next to the entrance they are surrounding. they will ask you to protect them as they go through the caves. you will agree and formally begin the quest. after starting the quest, there are two identical-looking cave entrances quite close by. if you teleport out during the quest, it is easy to go to the wrong cave entrance (the exit) and find you cannot enter the cave. you need to go to the south entrance, due west of the charm sprite hunter area (south of the hill giants), which has the quest symbol next to it on the mini-map. if you lose your pitch can when you exit, talk to flint when you return to get another. upon entering the caves, you will enter a room with several red fires. flint will give you apitch can, which allows you to create fires in front of you without logs and grants 2 experience points for each fire made. you may also right-click on the pitch can and choose the ""make fire here"" option, which will create a fire where you are standing. your first order of business is to light fires so that you create an arrow pointing out of the cave. once this is completed, a cut-scene will occur where the characters will join you in the middle of the room; the ground will begin to shake and everyone will fall through the floor into the next room. the second room will be dark, so you will have to light the fire pit next to you to illuminate everything. the firemakers will lament about being trapped, and are scared of some monster attacking them. in the centre of the room isfiremaking journal: chapter 1. after you take it, you will havefiremaking journal compilation (1)in your inventory. another cut-scene will then occur with a spirit,char, confronting you and the group, and again extinguishing the fire. once you relight the fire, you will see thatphoenixhas been killed becauseemmettbecame possessed. the spirit says this is part of her game, and she will allow you to pass through to the next camp, but you must identify who she has possessed to prevent any more deaths. now continue down the open tunnel. the third room (east is oriented at the top) contains yet more red fires, in another pattern that is in the journal. the journal contains guide images to complete the shapes as you advance through caves. complete the pattern to trigger another event wherecharwill begin dropping large boulders around the room whilst dimming the lights. you must avoid the boulders as they fall or you will be hit for as much as 1230+ damage, depending how many life points you have left. collect them and add them to the rock pile at the east end of the room to create a pile you can climb in order to reach the next exit. you can only carry one rock at the time. char will be dimming the lights, so you have limited time to do this. the puzzle can also be solved by omitting the fire in the bottom right corner and thus creating a shape with curved edges - 6 fires in total. if you wait until all the rocks have fallen before picking them up, you will start to hit damage for 250+ every couple of seconds. now you will be in the fourth room and you will need to light the fire to illuminate everything again. the firemakers will rejoin you. you can grab thefiremaking journal: chapter 2in the middle of the room, which will turn your journal compilation intofiremaking journal compilation (2). this will trigger another dialogue where you can gather more information from char by going through various dialogue options. you can then pick a firemaker who you think has been possessed, and tie them to a pillar. if you pick correctly, no one will die when char next dims the lights. the first person to be possessed is twig, which he gives away by both his exhausted stance and not being cowardly any more. click on the pillar closest to the fire and choose twig to tie him up. relight the fire and proceed to the next room. if you choose incorrectly, flint will be killed. the fifth room contains two differently coloured fires—red and yellow—arranged in the pattern of a fire, with the red on the outer layer and yellow on the inner. the room also containsred powderandyellow powder, which will allow you to change your fire's colour. a total of 4 yellow fires and 5 red fires need to be lit. it's possible to complete the puzzle in time if all the fires (except the yellow at the top left) are lit using ""make-fire-here"". start with the yellow fires by mixing the yellow powder. light the two fires on the right side, then the one at the bottom. next, run around to the top-left fire, which must be lit by standing in the ring of red flames and using ""make-fire"". then, mix the red powder and light the red fires in an counterclockwise direction: the two at the top, the one on the left, and the two at the bottom. another viable strategy is to from there, fill out the bottom right, then the left, then the two top-left using ""create fire here"". fill out the fire completely on both the inside and outside; the painting shown in the firemaker's journal isn't complete. in order to light the red fire that is very close to the wall, you need to select the ""light fire here"" option on your pitch can. upon completing this puzzle, char will summon a wall of fire. run for the gaps in the wall so you do not take damage. after surviving two different walls of fire from random directions (could be two different directions), proceed to the next room. the lights dim after a short time, dealing 50-100 damage every few seconds. lighting the fires postpones this effect. if you come close to dying in this room, you will be rescued by the firemakers and restored to full health. if this happens, any activated pillars will remain activated, but all lit fires will be extinguished. the sixth room is an agility-labyrinth puzzle. you need to push pillar switches to clear the path through to the exit, while lighting fire pits to keep the room lit to avoid extra damage. you must jump between pillars immediately after the small burst of lava has splashed or you will be hit for 50-200 damage. food will most likely be required to finish this room. there are small cut-scenes that show what happens when pushing a pillar, which makes it quite clear what to do next, so following that usually helps out a lot. you can be hit high amounts of damage, so be prepared to lose a lot of health. in the seventh room is thefiremaking journal: chapter 3, which will turn your journal intofiremaking journal compilation (3). after picking it up, you will have another conversation with char, and you will again have to decide who is possessed. the second person possessed issera, which is made clear by her failure to mention ignatius vulcan even once during the time in the room, and the fact that she says she has been a firemaker since she was a child; she is also suddenly not very irritable. tie her to the pillar, and move on to the next room. if you decide incorrectly, isis will be killed. once again you need to complete the pattern. fill in the gaps between the red fires to make two solid red lines, and likewise for the yellow fires. this will produce a ""#"" pattern. five yellow fires and four red fires will need to be lit. blue powder is provided, but doesn't need to be used. as usual, it's tricky to complete the pattern fast enough. one method is to light the red fires first, starting from the bottom right, then the left, then the top. next, switch to yellow and light the top row from left to right. generally, ""make-fire-here"" can be used, although there may be places where ""make-fire"" is quicker. after finishing the pattern, char will briefly speak with you before sending four more walls of flames across the room. those walls will have gaps in them too, but since the walls spawn rapidly after one another, it's best to stand in one of the gaps at either the west or the east of the room. in the ninth room, you'll see a grid similar to the pattern puzzle shown to you. you must survive in the room until the bar at the top of the screen is filled. on the walls are nodes which will create temporary walls of flame that will help you survive but will also prevent you from crossing them. char will put you through a ""tutorial"" of sorts, demonstrating the various flames she will send at you, but since she's feeling a bit cruel, you can still take damage during this trial. since the camera angle can't be changed during this puzzle, it may be helpful to close the chat and inventory panels to give access to all areas of the room. all balls of flame eventually vanish if they haven't hit you directly, but orange and blue balls will leave behind the same type of fires that blue flames leave; orange balls leave an ""x"" pattern that stretches across the entire board, originating at the time they vanished; and blue balls leave a 3x3 grid where they went out. the balls will spawn in four waves, with each wave containing more of them at the same time than the previous one. the idea here is to use the flame walls you set to prevent the balls from reaching you. however, if you aren't fast enough, or are on the wrong side of a node when you light it up, you may accidentally trap the ball on the same side as you. a few general tips are as follows: you should stay near the middle of the walls most of the time since the balls always spawn at four corners between the walls and the centre of the room, and they will not hesitate to go off if you're on top of the spawn, and you do not want to be surrounded. balls that are on top of a line when it is set off will become stuck in that wall, except for orange balls, since they're usually the ones that set the wall down in the first place. try to avoid the orange flame's walls, since they'll end up trapping you if you're at the short end of the room when they set fires, and always be aware of when the wave nears the end as the residual flames they drop when they leave spawn immediately. when you're hiding behind a wall, lure the balls over to one side, then create a wall perpendicular to the one you are using to block them so that when the first wall goes out, you'll still have something protecting you. lastly, the balls that try to chase you will still hurt you even if they're behind a wall, if they get close enough. a method of healing can be useful for this puzzle, allowing mistakes to be made without the risk of failing the puzzle and needing to restart. room ten is another party room where the rest of the firemakers will rejoin you. take thefiremaking journal compilation (4)and you will again have to decide who is possessed. the person possessed this time istwigagain. he gives it away when he says that he was born with the name ""twig,"" but ""twig"" is actually the nickname he gave himself, which he mentions if you spoke to him before entering the cave for the first time. if you decide incorrectly, lina will be killed. (there was a chat mistype upon quest release where twig says it's his nickname, not that he was born with it. it was later fixed, but for those who made the mistake causing lina to be killed won't have her back regardless). if you are playing in full screen format, you may want to make your screen size smaller to make this next part easier. this time, the pattern is in the shape of a torch. you won't need yellow at all; just complete the blue surrounding it and patch the red all around the pattern. but before you finish, take note of the fire pit nearby. instead of throwing firewalls at you, char dims the screen. immediately light the fire pit in order to avoid taking too much damage. then click the lit fire pit to take atorchfrom the pile, and proceed down the tunnel. you'll be forced to walk the entire way. during this time, dark tendrils will claw their way out of all sides of your screen. this is why smaller screen formats are recommended. if you use wide-screen, it will be nearly impossible to make out some of the tendrils against the pitch black of the area outside of the walls. you have to ward them off by left-clicking them close to the edge of the screen. failing to ward one of them off in time will result in moderate damage. don't forget to keep walking while this is happening, and escape through the open door as soon as possible. despite this option being safer, it is possible to simply walk the entire path taking hits. with a lot of food, a player can survive the entire path. after lighting the fire, take thefifth journal. the person possessed this time isemmett. during the interviews, you'll notice that emmett is suspiciously level-headed when you talk to him, as opposed to earlier, when he lit himself on fire just by talking about flames, making it a dead give-away. he also stops mentioning the fact that everybody keeps accusing him of being possessed. if you decide incorrectly, twig will be killed. char will warn you to prepare yourself. head back to the surface to resupply on food, and to take a fast-hitting and accurate weapon with you, such as anabyssal whip, chaotic weaponry, ordrygore weaponryif available. off-hand weapons are also effective, as well as ranged or magic weapons. armour should not be worn, since this will only increase char's maximum hit. use weight-reducing gear to conserve energy and if needed (if agility is low, perhaps), bring a few energy potions. this is asafebattle, meaning you are expelled from the battle arena instead of dying, with char taunting you. when this happens, the fight is reset and your stats and life are restored to full. if you have run previously out of food or char kills you, teleport outside of the dungeon, refill your food and come back. after teleporting out of the dungeon you will lose your pitch can, which you can get again from talking to flint. take the lastjournal, but discard it if you wish as it is not required when fighting char and can be obtained again from the cave. in the last room you will meetchar; she is standing in the cave downstairs. now is the time to get some food, energy potions (about 2), and weight-reducing clothing.summer piesare possibly the most ideal choice in terms of food, as they heal and restore 50% run energy. the salt-water spring atoo'glogis highly recommended, as it will provide unlimited run energy for about 15–20 minutes. the explorer's ring may be useful to replenish run energy. activating the ring may cause problems since it charges and delays your movement. you will be running a lot. char's hits on the player are based on the player's maximum life points, so wearing armour is probably counter-productive. prayers and the ring of recoil do not work in reducing/inflicting damage during the fight, so do not bother bringing these items to the fight. therapid heal,redemption, andfortitudeprayers may be helpful should you run out of food. the damage you inflict is calculated by how many fires you light with yourpitch can, that is, damage = n x 101, where n is the number of fires you have lit. for example, if you have 7 fires lit, you will hit 707; with 12 fires lit, you will hit 1212. therefore, it works well to light as many fires as you can in order to accelerate the fight. the lit fires die out naturally, and they can be extinguished in a 6x6 area by char when she stomps the ground. it is beneficial to light fires in the northern end and to keep char following you southward to prevent her from stamping them out. however, be sure to move away before she reaches you. one fast way to light multiple fires is to use the ""light fire here"" option and repeatedly light fires in a row from east to west. all fires made before the fight starts will disappear once the fight has begun. fires lit by the player during this fight areimpassableobjects. once you deem enough fires have been lit, begin attacking char with your melee, ranged, or magic weapon of choice. it is highly suggested that you put the pitch can on your ability bar. it's not necessary but it will make the fight much less click-intensive. you cannot set up adwarf multicannonfor the last boss fight, as you will receive a message stating that the cavern might cave in. summoning familiarscan be used when fighting char. a healing familiar such as aunicorn stallionorbunyipmay be helpful, or a beast of burden such as aspirit terrorbirdorwar tortoiseto hold extra food. a terrorbird can also replenish run energy withtireless runscrolls. it can be helpful to bring a shield and useresonanceto help heal from char's attacks. a well timed resonance can heal for over 3000. it may also be helpful to wear thewarpriest of armadylorbandosarmour set, as their passive ability has a chance to reduce the cool-down of resonance and other healing abilities by 15%. periodically, char will rage and glow white. during this time she will be invulnerable, and will inflict heavy damage (more than 8,000) upon you should you be within melee range. she will eventually cool down, which will happen faster if you lure her into the water. a message will appear in the chat window, ""char's rage subsides."" and she will cease to glow. it may only be worth luring her to the water if she begins glowing near the water. otherwise, it is recommended that you merely avoid trying to fight her at this point and run around the room lighting fires for when she becomes vulnerable again. if you have your audio turned on, you can hear when char switches to her rage even when she is not in your field of view. when enraged, char will deal massive damage if encountered. often a single hit will be sufficient to kill a player. as such, it is imperative to avoid her while enraged at all costs. if you attack char as soon as the ""char's rage subsides"" message appears, then you will have the longest possible time in which to fight her before she rages again. if you find that you are getting hit every time she rages, then it may be a good idea to back away before it happens and start lighting fires. occasionally char will give off a spherical spark, which will also appear as another yellow dot on the mini-map. the sparks will do a small amount of damage if they touch you, or will give certain benefits if they hit one of your fires. the sparks' benefits, which are short-lived and don't appear to help much, are: when char is down to approx. 50% health, fire walls—similar to those experienced in earlier chambers—will periodically appear and sweep across the room. a wall typically has 2 gaps where you can pass through to avoid damage from the wall of fire. you can alsosurgethrough the walls to prevent damage. going to the edge of the room will often avoid a wall of fire, even though it visually seems that the fire reaches to the room's edge. the walls may come from either side. once char has been defeated, she laments her defeat. the firemakers, who somehow become free, join the player, who can speak to char again and gain some final information about char and zaros. speaking to char after this gains no more information, and the player can exit the room through the nearby tunnel. this brings the player and the firemakers to the surface, at a cave entrance to the north of the one used to start the quest. speak to any of the firemakers to end the quest and get the rewards. (if you beat her, but clicked after her final dialogue box, and are just standing there with the other adventurers, taking light damage constantly, teleport out of there and come back to talk to her to finish the quest). the firemaker's curse is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

eventually, he will ask you to ask the barmaid for aguardsman's stouton his tab. when you ask the barmaid for a drink, she tells you that he has been in a lot lately, and that he used to go there with his lady friend, but she hasn't seen her in a while. give him his drink, which will start another talking cut scene. ask him about his lady friend. veldaban will say he hasn't been with anyone lately, especially not since the battle of barendir. after asking him about the battle, he then asks you to take him back to the black guard hq. a cutscene ensues. veldaban, still drunk, will call out supreme commander bisi. lieutenant brae will come out, trying to stop veldaban from doing anything rash, but veldaban goes inside anyway. he argues drunkenly with the supreme commander for a bit then leaves to sleep off his drunkenness. after the cutscene, head back to the south area of western keldagrim, passing through the watchtower where you fought the chaos dwarf cannoneer. open the package to remove the boot and place it in your inventory. use the boot on the footprints located south of the watchtower to reveal a longer trail leading to thekeldagrim south-west mine. follow the trail south, past the dwarven ferryman, then west across the bridge into an area with a mining icon on the minimap. retrieve the bowl from the package and use it on the fire in the mining cavern to put it out. remove the bowl. closer examination will reveal a socket at the bottom of the fire pit. take out the rod from the package then use it on the fire pit. once in the pit, turn the rod. a secret tunnel will open where a wall was to the west of the fire pit. enter the tunnel. continue heading west through the cavern and enter the doorway. try riding the cart (both hands should be free). after a short ride that returns you back to where you were, a message will appear, suggesting the player to go talk to veldaban if he's awake. when leaving the cave, there will be two options. select ""return to keldagrim"" and you will appear right next to the black guard hq in west keldagrim. talk to veldaban, telling him about the secret entrance and he will ask you if you are ready to go back and check it out with him. accept and he will follow. go back to the secret tunnel and back to the minecart area. veldaban will teleport to you if he gets too far behind, so don't worry about him getting caught on an obstacle. when you enter the minecart area, veldaban will say the area feels familiar, but he can't exactly remember. try to control the dwarven machinery and veldaban will tell you yellow and green stones can be used to control direction. ask veldaban to use the stones while you travel in the train cart (if, after entering the final cavern, veldaban is not there, log out then log back in). get in the train cart. every time you reach a junction, veldaban will ask you which stone to use. the green stone leads you left at a junction, and the yellow stone leads you right at a junction. the object is to find the right path to get through the maze. the answer is given below. pull the bridge lever to lower the bridge so veldaban can cross over. he will start following you, so move appropriately to get him across the bridge. head south to the cage and open the door to free thecaptives. talk tofjoila, the captive just inside the door. tell fjoila she should return to keldagrim and the captives will leave the cage. head south and turn the switch to open the doorway (veldaban will help). make sure you have your weaponry equipped then go through the doorway. you can activate either switch; veldaban will use the other. a cut scene follows of an ogre shaman transformingbrunoltinto a chaos dwarf. veldaban will remember he's seen this process before, crying out ""hilda! no!"", attracting the attention of thered axe directorandcolonel grimsson. veldaban will run into the grand exchange order slips room behind you. follow him inside. if you don't have a high combat level, you may want to turn onprotect from missiles, as a nearby hand cannoneer will appear and he can hit up to 380 if you are not praying against ranged. meeting fjoila. grunsh brainwashes brunolt with a spell. brunolt becomes a chaos dwarf! talk to commander veldaban, and he will reveal that hilda was abducted and transformed into a chaos dwarf. talk to him further and he will tell you about the sorting machine. grimsson will interrupt your conversation and reveal that the cannoneer defeated back at the tower in keldagrim was in fact hilda herself, who was veldaban's lady-friend. open your package and take out the metal rectangle and turnscrew. use the metal rectangle on the sorting machine to stop it. then use the turnscrew on it to unscrew it from the wall. an animated sequence will follow, showing the adventurer tipping the machine over, revealing an escape hole in the wall behind it. squeeze through the hole, ride the train cart (make sure both hands are free to do this), and a cutscene will follow, showing the adventurer and veldaban escaping and warning the consortium of the threat to keldagrim. congratulations! quest complete! forgiveness of a chaos dwarf is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:  "

the king eventually gives in and asks you to get the cat araw tunaso that they can get on. it can be fished injatizsoor can be stolen from afish stallinrellekka. procure araw tunafor hrafn, and proceed to talk to the king. he tells you that neitiznot has been docking a vast number of trade ships, and he's suspicious that they are up to something. just then, the king's chancellor,thorkelinforms the king that dwarf traders fromkeldagrimhave arrived early for their ore shipment, and that the city's miners are not capable enough to get the resources on time. as the king begins to dole out injustice to the miners, you offer to help mine out the ores. if required, the ores can be mined in the cave under the village, accessible by exiting the west gate and going north-east, or else pre-collected ores work too; after you have the assigned ores, hand them over to the king to be rewarded with some coins. with no more interruptions, king gjuki reiterates that theburgherof neitiznot is hatching an evil plan to down jatizso and wants you to retrieve more information on this matter since his spymaster, currently in neitiznot, has been in an accident recently. he tells you that the burgher and his henchmen speak with no holds barred when they are drunk, and being entertained; like his spymaster, you must also dress up in a costume to be allowed audience with the burgher. take thesilly jester costumefrom thechestbehind the king's throne. before leaving, the king tells you the password for reporting to his spymaster: ""free stuff please"". head back torellekkaand take a ferry toneitiznotby speaking tomaria gunnars, who stands just next to her husband, mord. from the docks, go up the muddy path into town and speak toslug hemligssenbehind the bank. before speaking to him, equip all four pieces of the jester costume and make sure nothing is equipped in your hands. after giving you an operative name, he'll send you off to the burgher's hall for entertaining him and concurrently listening in on the conversations of his council; you must do this while wearing only the jester costume as any and all audience are frisked before appearing before the burgher. with the costume equipped, head to the longhall south of the bank. speak tomawnis burowgarand tell him that you are an idle juggler looking for work (before speaking to him, dismiss any pet or follower you may have and deactivate any walking animations or the next scene will not load) . you must now engage and occupy the king's attention, doing everything he asks you to do by the jester control panel shown below, while keeping an eye on the guards' exchange: when do we assault the caves?i can be ready intwo days.good, my recruits are nearly ready.how many militia have you trained?seventeenso far.more shields will be completed by noon.and the armour?i will finish their armour tomorrow.and thetwo bridgeswe need repaired?i will fix them as soon as i can. after you finish your performance, head back to slug and tell him that about your acquired information. he'll ask you a few questions, the answers to which are emphasised in the above lines. content, he'll hand you a reward for your work and assign you to gain the trust of the burgher and extract more details. go to the longhall and talk to mawnis again, without the jester costume this time around. the burgher, like king gjuki, is also on the hunt for the outlander honoured with the fremennik title, but isn't ready to trust you quite yet. he asks you to prove your loyalty by helping the townsfolk in their tasks; the bridges to the north require extensive repairs and they require 8 lengths of rope. if you obtained the rope before talking to mawnis, you will get a humorous dialogue about how you ""figured you'd need it"". if you do not have any rope, kill theyaksoutside the town for someyak hairand spin it on the village's spinning wheel, in the south-east part of the island. be sure to also collect 3yak-hidesif you decide to make your own armour, as it will be needed later on in the quest. show the ropes to the burgher, and he'll send you on the next errand – retrieving 8split logs, which is obtained by slicingarctic pine logsonwoodcutting stumpsthat are situated on the island north of the city. collect the logs and show it to mawnis andthakkrad, the burgher's engineer. thakkrad instructs you to repair the bridges connecting neitiznot to the northern icy isles by right-clicking on the bridge and selecting repair. while repairing the bridges, you may get attacked by the ice trolls (runts,males, andfemales);protect from missileswill help you considerably reduce damage taken from their attacks. take caution that the hits will not register until you get off the bridge, so you can unknowingly be killed while repairing it. with the rope and split logs, go to the northern green isle and repair the two bridges on the left. it is recommended to repair a bridge, go back across it and repair the other bridge from that side, thus completely avoiding the trolls' attacks. go back and speak tomawnis burowgaragain; he'll pay you another reward for your efforts. now that you have entered the burgher's good books, he'll explain to you his important plan. theice troll cavesin the northern part of the isle houses an enormous horde of ice trolls, led by theice troll king. while their town were busy fighting with jatizso, the trolls grew in number, and as a result have initiated attacks upon the town and its citizens. mawnis has gathered a militia army for assaulting the caves, but being a cautious man, he wants all the help he can get. with your contributions in consideration, he requests you to lead his armies into battle. as a precaution, he also needs to know how much king gjuki is aware of their schedule, since they may misinterpret this assault on the trolls. leave the island and return to king gjuki on jatizso, informing him of the repaired bridges in neitiznot. before you can speak further, gjuki orders his chancellor to produce a financial report; the chancellor tells him that the city has an almost-empty coffer. enraged, the king demands a window tax to be placed on the citizens, so that they can supply their army with food and weapons; he then appoints you as the royal tax collector. before you can protest, the chancellor hushes you and pleads you to go along with the king's paranoid schemes. he gives you anempty tax bag, telling you to retrieve 1000 coins for each window, from the shopkeepers in the city. visit every shop and collect the tax from their owners – the armourer's hut (8,000 coins), weapon-smith hut (6,000 coins), eating hall (5,000 coins) and the food shop (5,000 coins) – for a total of 24,000 coins. take the tithe back to king sorvott, only to realise that there still isn't enough money to pay for the equipment. the king imposes another tax on his subjects, this time for anyone having facial hair. being the tax collector, you must visitraum urda-stein(armour trader),hring hring(ore trader),skuli myrka(weapon trader),flosi dalksson(fish merchant) andkeepa kettilon(chef), and collect 1,000 coins from each of them. with the bag now containing 29,000 coins, return to the king. the chancellor finally notes that there is enough in the treasury for the payment. not quite done with you, king gjuki orders you to perform another reconnaissance operation in neitiznot, as he has been notified that the burgher acquired some outside help for the bridge repairs. return to neitiznot, and speak withslugonce again. he tells you to spy on the burgher and his aides one more time, while wearing the jester costume and entertaining them. equip the jester suit, and speak to mawnis in the longhall to begin a cutscene. a rough capture of the guards exchange: what do you think of the burgher's champion?[he/she] seems honourable and courageous to me.what about their collaboration with king sorvott?well i trust mord gunnars, and he works for the king.and the champion did help you repair your bridges.yes, well. so are your militia ready?i have them anchored nearetceteria.then i shall sail thepotionsto them tonight.then we are ready to launch our raid at dawn?absolutely, long live burgher burowgar.and may the troll king be short lived. head back to slug and provide him with another report; he'll ask you some questions on it. the answers to the first two questions are emphasised above, and when he asks you the final question, you must reply with ""i have been helping neitiznot"". sail back to jatizso and inform gjuki that mawnis is gathering an army to attack the troll king. to your disbelief, he is still adamant that the burgher is out to get him; you quickly admonish him for his petty obsessions against his cousin. learning nothing, he orders his armies to attack the troll cave and gain glory before the neitiznot party, even after sound suggestions for joining them against a common enemy. he'll finally give you aroyal decreethat you need to deliver tomawnis burowgar, warning him that any interference would be assumed as an act of war. show the decree tomawnis burowgar, who remarks that they would never attack jatizso and void the truce that was signed by their fathers. moving on, he asks you to be guided through the traditions of neitiznot before leading the raiding party to the caves. if you have already made or bought the quest items, the following process can be skipped by talking to mawnis a couple more times. return to mawnis with the traditional armour of neitiznot, and he'll appoint you the 'champion of neitiznot', welcoming you into their clan. before leaving, mawnis tells you to bring the troll king's head as a trophy. his aide,fridleif, informs you that the army is positioned in the eastern ice caves, and that you should avoid the jatizso troops. wearing the yak-hide armour in the caves is highly recommended, as even though it is lower-tier, troll attacks are very efficiently blocked by it. the other armour slots can be filled with appropriate items, while your inventory should have prayer potions, lots of food, and optionally combat-boosting potions; also consider taking anemergency teleport(ectophial,crystal teleport seed,ring of life, anymagic tablet, etc). note that summoning familiars cannot be brought into the troll caves. when you are ready, proceed to the northernmost island, usingprotect from meleeif you brought thefremennik round shield, otherwiseprotect from missilesto save from considerable damage from the trolls. after entering the eastern caves, acut sceneensues; mawnis'honour guardshave already initiated combat with the ice trolls, helping their champion cross the bridge to assault the ice troll king. theice trollsuse both melee and ranged attacks – the troll males, grunts, and runts attack with melee, while the females throw large rocks at you. you must kill 10 of them in the caves before you can face the troll king. if at any time you wish to know your kill progress, simply look in your quest journal. bork sigmundsonis located near the cave entrance and will provide you with up to 9tunas, three 4-dosestrength potions, and/or three 3-doseprayer potionsupon request. make sure you have enough inventory space, as you can only ask him once for each resource. when you have killed 10 trolls, a message appears in thechatboxstating that you can now cross the bridge to the troll king. before crossing the bridge, make sure that you have enough health and a protection prayer (magicormissiles) switched on, since the troll king gets the benefit of the first strike. after killing the ice troll king, retrieve thedecapitated headfrom the corpse. to exit the caves, you can either walk back or use a teleport, avoiding risking death while running past the other trolls. back in the neitiznot longhall, speak to mawnis burowgar and hand him the souvenir, to which he offers you hisancestral helmetas a token of gratitude. he announces that he will now work towards bringing peace between the neighbouring towns, to which you bid him farewell. the fremennik isles is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

(remember, the default action is to drink the beer, so don't left-click it or you'll have to get another one!). he will give you astrange object– an item he picked up from his outings – as a gift.
be careful of the nearby wolf, as if it attacks you whilst in conversation with the workman you’ll lose the beer without acquiring thestrange object! go back to the longhall and take another keg first. if you try mixing the normal beer keg with the low alcohol one, manni will get angry and stop you. you will need a distraction. look to the outside of the longhall, on the eastern wall, for a pipe; light the strange object and place it inside. if you leave alit strange objectin your inventory for long enough, it will eventually explode and deal 20% of your current health as damage. enter the longhall and mix the low alcohol keg with the longhall keg. the bomb bursts with a loud noise, stunning everyone. finally, challenge manni for a rematch and you will win this time, gaining his vote. you should speak witholaf the bard, who is to the east of the longhall. he promises you his vote if you can prove your worth as a bard by performing at the longhall. the first thing you need is a lyre: once you have the enchanted lyre, go backstage through the north-east door that is guarded by a bouncer. play your lyre in front of the crowd. do not have two enchanted lyres on you when going up on stage, as both of them will be reset to a normal lyre after playing it (to avoid this, one lyre can be dropped whilst you play on stage and picked up again after the performance). olaf will be impressed and keep his promise of giving you his vote. sigli the huntsmanis near the entrance gate of rellekka. his task for you is to find and killthe draugen, an evil ghost that is said to devour the souls of brave warriors who meet their ends at sea. as it cannot be defeated by normal means, sigli provides you with ahunters' talismanto capture the draugen's spirit. keep using the talisman to locate the draugen. note: the location of the draugen differs from player to player. while you are trying to find him he may also change locations forcing you to start the hunt over. beware of wolves (level 60) in the woods. prepare yourself for combat and head south of rellekka toward the woods. start locating the draugen (level 96) by using the hunters' talisman. keep following the directions until the draugen appears and starts to attack you. once you have defeated it, the hunters' talisman automatically collect the draugen's essence. his combat level is 96 and he uses melee combat. he is fairly easy to defeat, although results may vary depending on your combat level. depending on his locations, there are oftensafe spotsavailable, like across fences, or having to run around rocks or mushrooms until you're on one side and he's on the other. the draugen's weakness is fire spells. after you defeat him once, return to sigli to get his vote. if you take too long to defeat the draugen, he will disappear and you will have to fight him again. do not lose the talisman as it contains the draugen's spirit. if you lose it, you will have to fight him again. peer the seercan be found south-west of the market. he will give you his vote if you can simply enter the front door to his house, and come out the other side. there is a catch though – you cannot take any items inside. peer the seer will offer to deposit any items you have on you for the remainder of the quest. to get in, you need to answer a puzzle. the answer is a four letter word, and peer will give you a clue for each letter and the word itself. possible answers include: ""tree"", ""time"", ""life"", ""mage"", ""fire"", ""wind"", ""mind"" and ""disk"". after you've solved the riddle, enter the building and go upstairs. search all of the objects and study theunicornandbull's headson the wall to find anold red disk, awooden disk, an uncookedred herring, ajug, and anempty bucket. you will also find ablue thread, apick, aship toyand amagnet, but these items serve no purpose in the quest. cook the red herring to getsticky red goopand use it on the wooden disk to get a secondred disk. then go down the other trapdoor and use the two disks on the abstract mural to get avase lid. you now need to get thevase, which can be found in the chest upstairs in his house. to open it, you must set exactly four units of water on it. you need the jug, which can hold 3 units of water and the bucket, which holds 5 units, to open the chest. here is what you should do: use the sealed vase with the frozen table to freeze the water, which then expands in the vase and shatters it. you will receive akey frozen in a block of ice(if you accidentally freeze the water without sealing it, use it on the range to empty it). thaw the frozen key on the range, then go down the eastern ladder again and out the exit to get peer's vote and a free herring, which you can eat. you can findsigmund the merchantin the market. he will want you to get him anexotic flower. this may sound easy, but you will end up having to complete a trail of requests from many people, similar to theone small favourquest. then give the promissory note to thora, the legendary cocktail to manni, the champions token to thorvald, the warriors' contract to the seer, the weather forecast to swensen, the sea fishing map to the fisherman, the unusual fish to skulgrimen, the custom bowstring to sigli, the tracking map to brundt, the fiscal statement to yrsa, the sturdy boots to olaf, the fremennik ballad to the sailor, and finally the exotic flower to sigmund. you will get his vote. talk to swensen in his house, which is southwest of the longhall, and south of the marketplace. your task is to navigate your way through his maze of portals. start by going down the ladder in the small room in his house. in each room, there are four portals: one on the north wall, one on the south wall, one on the east wall, and one on the west wall. one of the portals will take you to the next room. the other three will send you to a random room. the trick is to spell his name. first, go in the south portal, then the west, then east, then north, then south, then east, and finally north again (swensen). after you finish, talk to swensen to get his vote. thorvald the warrior can be found in the helmet store north of the longhall. his task is for you to fight a special warrior calledkoschei the deathlessas a test of bravery. there are three rules: if your combat stats are 40+, you should not find koschei to be a challenge to defeat. if you leave during any part of the fight, you will have to restart the fight from the beginning. also, if you die during the first three fights, it will be considered as a normal death and you will lose your items. legacy modeis recommended. you may use some constitution and defence abilities without a weapon (tuska's wrathcannot be used however), andaurasare allowed. the restrictions on items are similar toentrana, but stricter. notably, thorvald bans runes, bolts, arrows, evenarrowheads,bowstrings,unstrung bows,crossbow strings(logs or unstrung crossbows can be brought in, but are useless without string),summoning pouchesandscrolls(however, you can bring in a summoned familiar, with scrolls stored in them), while entrana does not. there are still a few ways to smuggle in combat equipment: you cansafe spotall forms of koschei, making the fight incredibly easy, possibly without taking any damage. south of the central pit in the area is a single large stalagmite. exactly 3 tiles to the east is a tile with 4 smaller stalagmites. while you cannot stand on any of the tiles between them, they constitute a safe spot; by getting koschei stuck west of the large stalagmite while you stand east of the smaller stalagmites (or vice versa), you can range or mage him without being hit by any of his forms (prayer is still drained). while you cannot safe spot him over the torches, you can still hide behind them to prepare. you can use food, prayer, potions, andrings of recoil. if you're wearing aring of life, un-equip it during koschei's fourth form, or else you will have to restart the fight from the beginning. also note that by the end of the fight, you will need at least one free inventory space to receive the fremennik blade – otherwise it will fall to the floor and if you leave the ""basement"" without picking it up, you will not be allowed to return to get it. go into the basement to begin fighting, after you bank all unnecessary items. peer the seer will bank all your items, regardless of task completion for this trial. beware that using his banking will deposit all your items. run over each of the 5 arenas until he spawns for the first time. if you take too long he'll disappear and reappear after you run around, and you'll start over at his first form. if you 'die' to koschei's fourth form, you'll find yourself in a bed upstairs, with thorvald granting you his vote, since it was a test of bravery, not strength. the following people are the remaining members of the council, but it is not possible to gain their votes, and as such, they do not play an important role in the quest. whileingais one of the council members, she simply won't give you her vote. she can be found just south of olaf, and if you talk to her, she will mildly insult you. you will, in turn, insult her. no matter what you do, she will always vote against you in the trials. when you askagnarfor his vote, he will say that he will vote for you if you give him 100,000,000,000,000,000,900,470,093coins. this is impossible as the maximum coins anyone can hold is 2,147,483,649,147,483,647. he can be found wandering the market square. sassilikis another council member who will talk with you but won't give you her vote. she is located just south-east of the furnace and forge. she states that she will vote for you on one condition; when your character asks what the condition is, she claims you are too gullible to become a fremennik. pontakis also a council member. he has a small gardening plot behind his house, which is useful for other parts of the trials, and even offers a sub-quest to perform to gain his vote. he asks you to obtain the following items in order to earn his vote: as these items simply don't exist (with the exceptions of cheese fromzanaris, and sleeping bags, which existed inrunescape classic), this is a brush-off to let you know that he won't vote for you no matter what you do. thefishermansits on the end of the middle dock fishing for stuff. as a council member, you can also attempt to persuade him to vote for you. the following are the terms he requires to cast his vote for you: in other words, he will never vote for you either. still, he can be helpful when you try to complete the task that sigmund the merchant has asked you to do, along with several other council members. after you have completed all the council members' tasks, go straight to brundt the chieftain. congratulations, quest complete! the fremennik trials is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

obtain thering of charos (a), you only need to complete thewise old man's test. to start the quest, speak toqueen ellamariain thevarrock palacegarden. when you mention the empty allotments, she says that they were recently installed as a surprise for her husband,king roald's birthday. she plans to create the finest garden, grown with exotic flowers and trees. when you offer to help, the queen rudely accepts, calling you a lowly peasant. she says that the seeds must not be obtained by killing ""everything that moves"", but rather through persuasion, before handing you alistof the things she needs and the people to talk to for retrieving them. with thering of charos, head todraynor villageand speak to thewise old man. the old man gives you a backdrop onqueen ellamaria, saying that she was just a common barmaid at theblue moon innbefore marrying roald. he also speaks aboutcharosand the origin of his ring. charos, a servant tolord drakan, fashioned a powerful ring that could enhance the wearer's innate coaxing skills upon wearing it. the old man agrees to reactivate your ring if he can be certain that you indeed have a knack for diplomacy. you do not need to answer all the questions correctly, as a majority will suffice. the answers to the questions are as follows: after answering the questions, thewise old manenchants your ring of charos. now, when wearing the ring of charos (a), you will be able to persuade the npcs on the queen's list by using relevant dialogue, indicated by(charm). if you do not have the onion, cabbage, and/or marigold seeds, you may head west to the draynor village market and purchase them fromolivia. alternatively, you may also steal from the seed stalls or pickpocket the nearbymaster farmerfor the seeds. the queen's garden does not have its own tool leprechaun, however there is one at the tree patch nearby. watering is not needed for the queen's garden; neither is compost, except for the two varieties of orchid seeds. you cannot pay off any farmer for watching your plants, as they must be looked after by you. remember to always equip your activated ring of charos while requesting the seeds from the farmers. it is recommended to plant any seed immediately after you obtain them, to save growing time. with the exception of the white tree, the plants do not take long to grow, so it is advised that you do them at the end. the npcs can be visited in any order, but it is recommended that you visit them in the order that follows: head todantaeraat thecatherbyallotment farming patch. speak to her with the ring of charos equipped and ask about the white tree. then follow up with thecharmoptions wherever possible. after convincing her that you're only trying to save a dying tree species, dantaera instructs you to cut a branch from thewhite treeon top of theice mountain, nearfalador. after talking to dantaera, go toice mountainvia any transportation method you want. the shortest paths are teleporting to theedgeville(this is recommended as you may save time by completing the requirement in the next section) orfaladorlodestone and walking up the mountain. climb to the northern side, near theoracle, and you'll find the white tree. take asamplingwith your secateurs (you may need to scroll across when choosing a tool), plant it in your filledplant potand water it. it will turn into awhite tree saplingwhen it is ready to plant in thepatchat queen's garden. from ice mountain, head east to themonastery of saradomin. at the north end of the area, you'll findbrother althricnext to his rosebush garden. try to take a seed from one of the rose bushes, and he will interrupt you and will immediately sense that you are using an unnatural power and ""concealing something of great evil"". he suggests you either throw the ""dark talisman"" down a well or simply destroy it. if you choose to drop the ring down a well, head north-east and throw the ring down the localwellwest of theedgevillebank. return to the monastery and attempt to take the seeds. althric will be pleased that you have ""taken the road back towards the light"" and will gladly allow you to pick a fewred,pink, andwhite rose seedsfrom his rosebushes. before departing, althric will accidentally let slip a suggestion on how one might retrieve the ring of charos. to do so, use afishing rodorfly fishing rodon the well again. it might take several tries, but you will eventually get it back. if you choose to instead destroy the ring, you will have to go tofenkenstrain's castle(or the windmill's basement onharmony island, if you've completedthe great brain robbery) and pickpocketdr fenkenstrainto recover it. either use thecanifis lodestone, orfairy ringto thehaunted woodsby codealq, or anectophial, or charter a ship fromport

ahoyhas not been completed. go to the undead farm between port phasmatys and the fenkenstrain's castle and speak tolyraat the allotments, ask her if she has any orchid seeds to spare. follow up by selecting thecharmoption until she requests you to grow someonionsfor her. agree to her offer without using thecharmoption. to save time, you can move on to the next seed while the onions grow – wait until it advances to the next growing phase, water it and cure disease, if needed.supreme growth potionscannot be used for this. plant some onion seeds in an empty allotment, water the plantation every turn (every 10 minutes for onion seeds) and cure any disease, if necessary. if you have fully grown marigolds planted in the nearby flower patch, you do not need to worry about the crop becoming diseased. the onions grow in roughly 40 minutes, after which you'll get the message, ""perhaps i should check the onions that i planted for lyra..."". when the onions are fully grown, make sure you have two open inventory slots as you will need two sets of orchid seeds in order to complete the quest. head to the farming patch just north ofeast ardougneand in north area ofplayer owned farmand speak tokragenat the allotments. ask him if he has any snowdrop seeds to spare, and then select thecharmoption until he requests you to grow some cabbages as a gift for him and agree without using thecharmoption. if you plant the cabbages before talking to him, you will need to plant them again. plant some cabbage seeds in an empty allotment, water the plantation every turn (every 10 minutes for cabbage) and cure disease, if necessary. if you have fully grown rosemary planted in the nearby flower patch, you do not need to worry about the crop becoming diseased.supreme growth potionscannot be used for this. the cabbages grow in roughly 40 minutes. once fully grown, you'll get the message, ""perhaps i should check the cabbages that i planted for kragen..."". make sure to have two open inventory slots before you harvest the cabbages. go to the allotments between falador andport sarim, and talk toelstanaboutdelphinium seeds; you can use the ""cabbage-port"" teleport with anexplorer's ring3 or 4, and walking north to reach there. alternatively, you can use the draynor lodestone and walk slightly south-west to the cabbage patch, and go north. he agrees to give you some seeds, if you can grow somemarigoldfor him. ask him if he has any delphinium seeds to spare, and then select thecharmoption until he requests you to grow some marigolds as a gift for lyra, and then agree without using thecharmoption. plant a marigold seed in the nearby flower patch, and grow it. if you give him a marigold you obtained before the quest or plant one before talking to him, he will tell you he

repeat until you have correctly dyed all the three mast sections. the colours are random for each player, and some colours can be made as follows: after dyeing the model ship correctly, climb down a level and speak with theold man. show him the toy boat, and he'll recognise it. you've found netty's son! when you return him his ship, he will give you achest key. enter the captain's quarters, and use the key on the chest inside to receive apiece of a map. proceed to the north-west part of the ship's deck, where there is a gangplank you can walk out onto and get to some rocks. jump along the path of rocks (you need 25agilityto attempt this part). it is possible to fail the jumps, which will cause you to lose 50 to 510 life points. at the end, you'll find a closed chest containing another map piece. retrieve it, and jump back to the ship. climb down to the lowest level of the wrecked ship, and open up and search each one of the chests (locked chests can be ignored) - one of them houses a level 42giant lobster(weak toair spells) who will jump out to attack you. kill it, and search the chest again to get the last piece of the map. now fit all the map scraps together to form atreasure map. head back intoport phasmatys. grab the treasure map and a spade, and head north-east of the bank to theghost captainof a small rowing boat on the south dock; talk to him to travel todragontooth island. you must have the map and a spade in your inventory before proceeding to dig, as the spade on the tool belt will not work. once on the island, use the map to find the treasure. stand beside thestatue of saradomin, under his extended arm is the start point. the map's drop down menu has a ""follow"" option. starting at the start point underneath the statue, read the instructions on the map and then use “follow” to step in the direction, and then number of squares, as the map tells you to. once you have followed the map directions with the right number of steps, dig at the marked spot to obtain thebook of haricanto. finally, have the ghost captain take you back to port phasmatys. talk toak-haranu, a human wandering around the docks, just east of the inn. he'll tell you he has the manual, but he'll barter it for the famous robin's signature on anoak shieldbow. walk inside the inn, and talk torobin, who challenges you to a game ofrune-draw. players take turns drawing runes from a bag of 10 runes. each rune has a different point value, with air being worth 1 point all the way up to a nature rune being 9 points. if you choose the ""hold"" option, you choose to not draw any more runes. the player with the most points wins the game. however, drawing a death rune results in an automatic loss. there is a larger chance that you will draw a death rune than robin. a bet of 25 coins is placed every game, and you must win four hands - enough so that robin owes you 100 coins; losing hands does not affect your win counter towards the 100 coins. after you threaten to tell the ghosts of what he is doing, he will give you asigned oak shieldbowto repay the debt. take the signed shieldbow back to ak-haranu and he'll give you thetranslation manual. speak to theghost innkeeper, and ask him if he has any jobs for you. he will give you abedsheetthat he wants you to take to robin. but rather than doing that, just take it with you. go to the bottom of theectofuntusand dip thebedsheetinto the pool. if you forget something and try to charter a ship from or toport phasmatys, the sailors will not let you travel with the bedsheet, requiring you to bank it first. if you have anelder divination outfit, you can use it to teleport to theradiant wispcolony ondragontooth islandand take the boat back toport phasmatyswithout requiring to bank it first. talk togravingas, the ghost activist holding a big sign protesting against necrovarus, west of the inn. he'll give you apetition formto collect signatures from the townspeople. put your bedsheet on, as theghost villagersare rather distrustful of humans after necrovarus, and gather 10 signatures from them. it's not too hard; as long as you don't talk to the same person twice in a row, you can ask the same two or three ghosts for all 10 signatures. don't worry if a ghost asks for ecto-tokens - simply ask a different ghost if you don't want to pay. with all 10 signatures, talk to gravingas, who will ask you to go tonecrovarusand present him with the petition form. necrovarus will get so angry over the dissension that he'll burn the petition and drop abone keyduring the process. pick it up and head upstairs. use the key on the locked door to get into his room, as the nearby ghost disciple won't let you in. open and search thecoffinto find themystical robesthat belong to necrovarus. return to netty with the robes, book, manual, and your amulet of ghostspeak in your possession (cramuletsdo not work). teleporting to thecanifis lodestoneand running north west is a quick way to get to her. hand over the items to her, and she'll cast the spell on your amulet, doing the old ""dance"" emote. equip the newly acquiredenchanted amuletand head back to the ectofuntus. talk to necrovarus and command him to release all the ghosts he's holding. you can also ask him to tell a joke or do a chicken impression without discharging the amulet. just keep going through the conversation until the very end. enter port phasmatys one last time, free of charge, and talk to velorina to tell her the good news. congratulations, quest complete! ghosts ahoy is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

axebeginning his plan. he founded the consortium: the gathering of mining companies that were to serve the monarchy. but, eventually, the monarchy came to serve the consortium. by the time of his death, the monarchy was all but abolished. now the kings in keldagrim are but a distant memory... with only the statue of king alvis to remind the people of the old days, the dark days. so begins the rise of the red axe, the new multi-part storyline centered[sic]around the dwarves and their capital of keldagrim. the first quest, the giant dwarf, introduces the city and the powerful business consortium that rules the dwarven realm. discover weird goings-on, narrowly escape from falling chunks of rock, ride around in minecarts and... make sure you don't bump into the wrong person on the way to the city! to start, speak to thedwarven boatmaninside themineeast ofrellekka. to get to him enter the cave in the north side of the east ofrellekka, close to fairy ringdks. as soon as you enter, walk east and enter the cave entrance shaped like a crack in the wall in between the two statues to go tokeldagrim. the boatman will ask if you want to cross the river to keldagrim. say yes, and head north to the small building with a door on either side. upon going through the north door, acutscenewill introduce you to the red axe quest series, then the boatman will crash his boat into the giant dwarf statue. you will be arrested, and taken tocommander veldaban. commander veldaban will say that your arrest was for nothing but to talk with him, and asks you to replace the statue. talk toblasidar the sculptor. he lives in the eastern side of keldagrim, across the bridge, south of the kebab shop. he will make the statue if you can get him clothes, an axe and boots fit for a king. these three sections may be done in any order. talk tovermundiwho is in the south-western corner of the east marketplace (indicated by the silk symbol) and ask her about making the king's clothes. she can, but first she needs a picture of the clothes. talk to thelibrarianin the house in the northeast corner of west keldagrim and he will tell you to search the library for a book about dwarven clothes. you must speak with the librarian before you are able to find the book. climb the bookcase in the north-west corner with a ladder in front of it to find thebook on costumes(scholars guide to dwarven costumes). if you're carrying 30 kg or more, you will be unable to climb it. you can deposit your items in the nearby bank to reduce your weight. take the book back to vermundi, who needs 1coal(there are rocks in the north-east of the city) and 1 set of logs (there are dead trees right outside the cave) to get the clothing machine running. use them on the spinning machine and use your tinderbox on the spinning machine. now pay her 200 coins for theexquisite clothes. go back to the sculptor's house and give the exquisite clothes tohis model. talk tosantiri, who is in the sword shop all the way in the north west of west keldagrim. he talks about how his family came to possess the battleaxe, and then mentions that it has been damaged and that the sapphires on the hilt had either been stolen or washed away. during the dialogue where you offer to repair the axe santiri may note your mastery ofsmithingbut exclaims that even you aren't skilled enough. he also says that the blade itself is not up to scratch anyway, but that only animcando dwarfcould repair it. if you have completedthe knight's swordquest, your character will mention that they know an imcando dwarf. you can then just skip the library part of this quest and teleport toport sarimto go seethurgo. talk to thurgo regarding the battleaxe repair. he will ask you for aniron bar, after which he will fix the battleaxe for you. you then have the option to be transported back to keldagrim straight away. with three sapphires in your inventory, use one of them with the newly sharpened dwarven battleaxe to repair it back to its former glory. use the fully repaired axe on the model. santiri will then refer you to the librarian, just east of his shop, who you have to ask about finding animcando dwarf. if you have not yet reached the part where you learn about the imcando, then go toreldoin the varrock library and he will teach you about them. you must talk to the librarians in keldagrim first about the imcando and then to reldo; going to reldo or thurgo alone will elicit no special giant dwarf quest dialogue. use a varrock teleport/lodestone to get to varrock, besides the cart in eastern keldagrim. as of thelodestoneupdate, the quickest way to get toport sarimis using the home teleport spell and teleporting directly to port sarim, provided the lodestone is unlocked, and walking due south. alternatively, if you have access to thefairy ring system, the code to mudskipper point isaiq. go to thurgo with an iron bar and a redberry pie, and ask him to repair the axe. he is in the house with an anvil symbol in mudskipper point, south-east of rimmington and south of port sarim. if you give him the pie before asking if he's an imcando, you will need another pie in your inventory to unlock the conversation tree but you do not need to give it to him. do not attempt the drop trick with the completed axe once thurgo has repaired it. thurgo will supply you with another (iron bar) repaired axe if you drop the one in your inventory, but it is ungemmed and you will need to repair it with another threesapphires. you will be unable to pick up the axe you have dropped. when thurgo is finished with the axe, you have the option to return immediately to keldagrim. with three sapphires in your inventory, use one of them with the newly sharpened dwarven battleaxe to repair it back to its former glory. use the fully repaired axe on the model. go to the south-west anvil on the west side of keldagrim (south of the black guards' headquarters) and asksaroabout theboots. he sold them todromund, another dwarf in keldagrim. speak to dromund in his house just north of the bank. when finished, take theleft bootfrom the table when he is not looking. his back has to be turned to successfully steal the boot. if you try taking the boots before talking to dromund, a message will pop up saying, ""you do not need this boot."" go outside and around the house until you are at the window next to theright boot, and usetelekinetic grabon the boot from the outside when dromund is facing away from you (the regular spell book is required to do this). give the items to riki the sculptor's model, if you have not done so already, and talk to blasidar again. he will tell you that the directors of the consortium cannot agree on the face for the statue, as each company wants its own director's face. he will agree to make the statue up to the neck. a cutscene will ensue, showing the statue, before which you will not be able to join the consortium. your job is to get an agreement amongst the consortium members. there are eight mining companies in the consortium, each stationed in the upstairs of the marketplace at the top floor of the palace over the river. you need to impress and join one of them. the companies you may choose from are: the secretary of your chosen company will ask you to get them a few random ores in groups of 2-5 within a time limit. repeat this five times until the secretary lets you speak to the director. if you already have the ores in yourmetal bank, you may withdraw them from the furnace on western side of the ground floor of the palace. if not, the optimal way to do this is to obtain the task, then go to the grand exchange via the minecarts in the southeastern part of keldagrim, where the ores/bars can be bought easily. then use the trapdoor in the northwest corner to quickly travel back to keldagrim. this method takes no more time than running to the west keldagrim bank. the items cannot be noted. logging out, starting the dialogue over, or declining the task will reset your progress. assuming you have the required mining level, you may ride the minecarts to ice mountain and mine the available ores yourself. after completing five tasks, the secretary informs you that the director wishes to speak with you. once the secretary allows you, you will now have to do one to four tasks for the director – they'll ask for bars instead of ores. once again, by using the minecarts you can either buy the desired bars from the grand exchange, or mine the ores yourself from ice mountain and cast superheat item, thus removing the need to travel to a furnace (though one can be found in keldagrim's western marketplace), or by withdrawing them from any source that is connected to the player's metal bank. another simple method for saving time is to fill your inventory with different ores (secretary) or bars (director) before asking for the next task. if you have up to 5 of an assortment of ores/bars, you can get a task, and if you dont have it in your inventory, decline or leave the conversation and ask again. you will most likely receive a different task. you can withdraw ores from the furnace downstairs, and you can make bars in the furnace or withdraw from an anvil/forge (southwest of the west keldagrim bank). this will allow you to likely complete all tasks for each person without leaving. after you have done the tasks for the director, ask to join the company. then say that blasidar sent you and that you would support him and then when he asks, volunteer to support the director at the next consortium meeting. you will get a message telling you to return tocommander veldabanwho will take you to the meeting (an amusing cutscene will play). go back to the headquarters west of the keldagrim bank, you will support the director and receive somemeeting notesas well as your reward. if you want to skip this cutscene, you can just click on the ground while in the meeting. clicking on the ground will cause the screen to black out and you will be awarded the rewards for completing the quest. the giant dwarf is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: "

manages to fight and kill the horned ape-like creature, but is cursed in the process by some kind of magic, which renders him into his current form: ayeti. following the cutscene, he says he also doesn't remember asleif helping him. vargas, using the pen you made for him inthrone of miscellania, writes down what he remembers of the directions to the cave. the directions, after the addition, read: to reach the creature's cave:from rellekka, head east.... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...search the coast for unusual signs. next, travel toneitiznot, and speak with mawnis burowgar. he too, offers to tell you his side of the story. in this cutscene, you see the sameice beastas before, and nial is again part of the adventuring group. the gnoeal spits green goo at nial, who takes the brunt of the attack. asleif asks if anyone else is hurt, and mawnis says a little bit landed on vargas. vargas then melodramatically screams ""it hurts, it hurts!"". nial, suffering the most damage, is corrupted and transforms into a yeti. he eventually kills the gnoeal, but then turns on brundt. asleif realises that nial is ""quite out of his mind"", and they all flee. following the cutscene, mawnis says he has barely heard from brundt since and suggests that vargas may have forgotten large elements of the story and inflated his own role. he writes for you what he remembers of the directions to the cave. the directions, now complete, read: to reach the creature's cave:from rellekka, head east.at the foot of the mountains, turn north across the ice.search the coast for unusual signs. follow the instructions on thedirections, which lead to therellekka hunter area.fairy ring codedksconveniently teleports you just south-east of the area. head to the north-western corner of the hunting area's upper platform, and inspect the tracks of an ape-like creature you find there. if you are unable to see the footprint tracks, try switching tohdor lowering the brightness in the graphics settings. choose the 'inspect tracks' option for each print, and follow the footprints to theice moundto the east of where you started. dig out the mound of ice to create acave entranceand try to climb down it into the icy passageway. thehunting expertstops you and warns it's dangerous down there, but proceed anyway. once inside therellekka hunter area dungeon, dash to the far southern wall;yetisandgnoealswill attack you. low-levelled players may want to turn onprotect from magicto prevent damage from the gnoeals. look for a tunnel to the west along the southern wall, and enter inside it. the passageway is marked with a dungeon icon on the minimap. upon entering the chamber, you are attacked bynial swiftfling's yeti form. nial attacks with melee and ranged and is reasonably powerful, so keep track of your health. nial is also able to knock you back when he roars (like theice troll kingduringthe fremennik isles), and will do so every three to four hits. when nial says ""grrr,"" right before pushing you back, switch toprotect from magicprayer to reduce the damage.necromancyattacks and abilities do not work on nial. if you die while fighting the nial, agravestonedoes appear. if you kill nial and die at the same time, you will have to kill him again to receive the items necessary to finish the quest, or if you fail to pick nial's drops, another nial spawns to the south. when defeated, nial drops aherb pouch,nial's throwing axe,unfinished astral rune,yeti hair, and somebig bones. if your quest diary still says to investigate the cave after you have killed nial and picked up his items, go back in the cave, kill him again, and pick up everything he drops. you will get a few of the same items. now, that passage in your quest diary should be crossed out and you may go talk tofreygerdonjatizso. exit the dungeon, and head tojatizso. speak withfreygerd, who is wandering around on the west side of the island, near the city gates and west of the anvil and weapons shop. she says she wants to move back to neitiznot, to live with herbrother, butking gjuki sorvott ivhas threatened her with an emigration tax. enter the city, and go to the checkerboard-floored building west of the bank, where you can find the king. you have a delightful chat with the king, where you manage to convince him to not implement any new taxes. return to freygerd, and tell her the king has given her special dispensation. she now says that for years she has been growing more worried about nial, after mawnis had told her that he had turned into a yeti. after being informed that you found her husband and laid his soul to rest, she feels relieved. give hernial's throwing axeas a parting gift and she tells you to send her regards to her brother, mawnis. travel toneitiznotto tell mawnis of his sister's imminent return to the island. he says that this is excellent news, and he will attend the feast after all. travel to miscellania, and speak withking vargasagain. you two talk about the mountain daughter'sherb pouchyou found in the cave. you think it might be useful, and you tell vargas you will try to findasleif. head to themountain camp; some quick ways to get there are by using the fremennik province lodestone and running south-east, or aring of slayingteleport to therellekka slayer caves, or using the fairy ring code (ajr). before heading up the path to the mountain daughter, take apoleand aplankfrom the goat pen behind jokul's tent, just north ofhamal. alternatively, you can use astaff(such as adramen stafforearth staff) instead of the pole. now, head up to the shining pool, which is just north of jokul's village. climb the tall tree, use the pole or staff on theclump of rocksto vault over them, and use a plank on theflat stoneto reach the small island in the middle of the lake. call for asleif by choosing the listen-to shining pool option on the bubbles escaping from the lake (northside). the spirit of asleif hamalsdotter finally appears to you. talk to her, explaining her the situation involving her and the adventure. when you tell asleif that vargas has no memory of her caring for him, she tells you he has always been like that and only remembers what suits him. finally, ask if she can cure vargas. she says she can try and starts to give you instructions: if you lose your yeti hair, you can obtain more by killing the weakeryetisin therellekka hunter area dungeon. after creating the cure, return toking vargasand hand him theyeti curse cure. he turns back into a human and agrees to attend the feast. he also takes theherb pouchas a remembrance of asleif. finally, return torellekka, and talk tobrundt the chieftain. you show him theunfinished astral rune, which helps him recall more from the failed adventure. you impatiently watch a cutscene, where brundt remembers an additional member of their adventuring group called the mysterious mage, who turns out to be a much youngerbaba yagaof themoon clan. talk tomanni the revellerafter brundt's cutscene for a final, celebratory cutscene. congratulations, quest complete! to claim the additional rewards, speak withbaba yagain herchicken-leg houseonlunar isle. you must talk to her about theastral rune. make sure you have theunfinished astral runewith you. she tells you it is her lucky rune and asks if she can have it back. she also offers to tell you a story. tell her you want to know the bits the other adventurers don't remember. in this cutscene, you again see the adventurers in thedungeon, fightingnial. theprophecy tabletis on the ground, behind vargas. baba yaga picks up the tablet and then casts thetele-group fishing guildspell to save them from nial. in front of the guild, brundt asks baba yaga to give him the tablet, but she refuses. she casts thecure otherspell on vargas, hoping it will help him, and then casts a spell that clears the memories of the group. the spell shows birds circling around the adventurers' heads, much like the stun emote when you unsuccessfullypickpocketan npc. she then teleports away. back in the present, baba yaga said she kept the tablet, thinking it might be useful, but soon lost hope of that. she exchanges theunfinished astral runefor aprophecy tabletand anantique lamp. when you read the prophecy tablet, it says ""and his/her name will be [your fremennik name]."" glorious memories is directly

cabbagemancer that resided here, which meant that there was nobody maintaining the altar, causing it to explode, in an attempt to lure you here to steal your disk of returning so that he can be released out on the surface. fight the black knight titan where after beating him, he will respawn and attack the player again. after you beat him a second time crispy the cabbage will interrupt and ask you to throw him up to the roof so that he can get help in beating the titan. beat the titan a third time to trigger a cutscene showing that the cabbage returned to the farm to ask for the gower brothers help, at which point they will arrive at the life altar. your health and prayer points will also be replenished. attack the black knight titan again, where he will now attack using both of his weapons allowing him to deal damage faster. once he has been defeated for the sixth time he will lay down defeated, saying that he will never be released out on the surface. andrew reveals that there are plenty of disks and that he gives one to the titan, allowing him to be released. this is a safe battle; if you die, you will respawn in behind the scenes without losing anything. however, you will need to start the fight over from the beginning. speak to the gower brothers where you will tell them about the altar and the previous cabbagemancer that resided here, where they decide that

on the lastsmall islandof the bridged chain of islets east ofyanille, past somejungle spidersand up the ladder. if you can use thefairy rings, the codeclswill put you right on the isle. trying to speak to him, he will speak in a foreigngnometongue. hand him the sample, he studies it, and responds in incomprehensible speech, yet you can make out one word – ""daconia"". he complies with your request to write it down for you, and hands you amessagefor king narnode shareen. after following the translation book together with the scroll, the text reads: a man came to me with the king's seal.i gave the mandaconia rocks.and daconia rocks will kill the tree! return back to king narnode shareen inside the grand tree where you started. when he asks you if you understood what hazelmere told you, tell him that you did, although that might not be the case. the message will need to be reconstructed by choosing each translated line from the conversation (choose the 'none of the above' option of the dialogue until the correct wording appears). after giving him the message, king narnode shareen tenses up at the thought of the daconia rocks. when you ask him about the rocks, he says that they are a fail-safe method, created by hazelmere, to destroy the tree in case it grows out of hand. the king wants you to help thegnomes, by assisting them in finding the rocks. he also requests you to warn the chief of the three tree-guardians,glough, of the imminent threat to the stronghold. climb up the ladder to the tree house located just south-east from the fence of the grand tree, near the gnome guards, to find glough. greet him while eating to inform him of the daconia rocks theft, and he will snark back arrogantly. you mention the situation to him, and he automatically presupposes the fault of the humans, even saying they'll invade thegnome stronghold. being completely untrusting towards the humans, he tells you that you should report back to the king. apparently glough resents the human race as such. return to king narnode shareen. asking him for news about the situation, he will tell you that glough has already caught the culprit – a human who was carrying three daconia rocks, who has been detained. while you ask to see the detainee, who is on the top floor of the grand tree, the king hints that the tree itself is rather tall. go up the ladder to the top floor of the tree to findcharlieimprisoned in a cage, and talk to him through the wooden bars. when you interrogate him for a motive, he will blurt out that he was only following orders, doing what glough had paid him to do. charlie had gone tothe gnome on the hillwho gave him daconia rocks for glough in exchange of showingthe seal, and that you should search glough's house for evidence. go back to glough's house again – search the cupboard and you will find hisjournal. after reading the journal, you find out that glough is blaming all of the evils of the world on humans, even denying them the possibility of a good natured spirit. when you confront glough for being a spy, he will become outraged and will order his guards to arrest you and throw you into the jail you've just visited, putting you together with your cell-mate charlie. talk to charlie and he'll tell you that if you want to gather more information about glough's plans, you will need to talk to the foreman at the karamjashipyard, to which charlie apparently had to deliver vast quantities of gold. he also gives you a keyword that seaman use –ka-lu-min– so that you can work undercover in glough's crew. the king will appear and apologise for glough's actions. he will tell you to take thegnome glider, as glough has set up guards on all other escape routes. now go across the bridge from the cage and talk tocaptain errdoin the clearing north of charlie and he'll fly you tokaramja. unfortunately, for some reason the glider crash lands just west of the ship yard. be careful at this point, as you might get attacked byjogresat the crash site if yourcombat levelis too low. walk towards the shipyard and try to open the gate; you will be stopped by the worker at the passage. tell him that glough sent you, and give him the password (ka-lu-min) that charlie told you. if entered correctly, the worker will apologise for stopping you and let you through. after getting inside, go to theforeman, who is towards the end of the southern docks, and either talk to him and answer his interrogation, or kill him. if you decide to kill him but have low life points, you can buy 10 bananas from the crew member nearby. if you chose to answer the foreman's questions instead, the answers can be obtained from reading glough's journal. once you answer the foreman's questions, he will tell you about glough's plan to invade the humans and then give you alumber order. if instead you killed the foreman, he will drop the lumber order, which states glough's plan to take overgielinor. he plans to kill the grand tree and use it to create and launch 30 battleships toport sarimand proceed with an attack against the humans. as the glider was broken in the crash, and the fact that glough has put you on the no-fly list and ordered the gate guards to not let you in, you'll now need to enter the tree gnome stronghold via an alternate route, or enlist the help offemiat the main gate. even if you show king narnode shareen the lumber order from the shipyard, he will still not believe your accusations. speak to charlie again on the top floor of the grand tree. he will suggest you speak toanita, glough's girlfriend. anita can be found in the second tree house to the west of the swamp, north-west of the grand tree. talk to her, and she will ask you to returnglough's keyfor her. go to glough's house and use the key to open the chest. inside, you will find someinvasion plansdetailing his plan to seize control over gielinor. take the notes to king narnode shareen, who still won't believe your evidence; when they searched glough's house, all they found were somestickslashed together. take the sticks from the king. before returning to glough's house, equip yourself for battling the level 98black demon. you can access a bank by going up the ladder next to the king, and heading south-west. return to glough's house and climb up to the watchtower. you will find four small pillars. use the sticks with the pillars to spell out tuzo which, using your translation book, means ""open."" you will hear some gears turning, and the trap door on the platform opens. enter, but be prepared. the trapdoor ladder breaks right after you start the fight, so teleportation is the only way for a quick escape. after you enter, make sure to wait until glough walks up to you and starts the conversation. if you move before he gets to you, you will have to exit and go back through the trap door. after you enter, and glough talks to you, he will send a level 98 black demon to attack you. the demon is very strong and can hit over 1000 using melee attacks, soprotect from meleeis recommended to ward off some damage from its attacks. unlike black demons everywhere else in gielinor, this demon cannot use magic and is weak to water spells, instead of bolts. hiding behind the rocks directly south or going down the tunnel slightly will prevent the demon from using melee attacks and allow you to defeat it without taking much damage of your own. be advised that you'll be unable to retrieve any spent ammunition after the battle. after defeating thedemon, walk along the passage to the north until you findking narnode shareenstanding by a ladder. talk to him and tell him that glough had sent a demon to attack you, but the king still does not believe you. he finally sends a guard to scout for glough, to which the guard comes back with glough, who was hiding amongst the stones. the king apologises and asks you to locate the last daconia rock. while the roots can be searched prior to speaking with the king, you will be unable to find the daconia rock unless you have talked to him. search the roots all around the area until you find the daconia rock. though it can be time-consuming, you might need to search all of the roots. if you accidentally destroy or lose the rock, it'll spawn in the root where you first found it. after obtaining the rock, talk to king narnode shareen again for your reward for saving the grand tree. congratulations, quest complete! the grand tree is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

you'll need to use your diving gear to traverse the water. run past the zombie pirates and repair the stairs at the far end of the tunnel. climb up the stairs and up the ladder, then look through the peephole to spy on the enemy. it is revealed that mi-gor is using sleeping gas all over the island to produce enhanced zombies for a greater force, who goes by the name of 'rabid jack'. when he finds out that the gas production is unsatisfactory, he reprimandssorebones, saying that they will be sent to 'the box', which scares them to their bones. he then mutters to himself, seeming pleased at the thought of exchanging the enhanced zombies for test subjects to vivisect. go back and inform brother tranquillity of mi-gor's plan. he'll suggest you get aprayer bookthat can be used to pray away the poison. travel to themonasterynearedgevilleto find it in a bookshelf situated in the south-west corner of the building on the ground floor. grab a holy symbol, head back to the island and talk to brother tranquillity, who speaks about 'words' and locusts; read the prayer book and he will take you back to harmony. the gas is seeping quickly into the granary, so recite the prayer book by right-clicking on it. if you walk outside before you use your book you will suffocate and wake up back inside the windmill. equipping your diving gear can help you stay outside, despite the gas. now that the monks are no longer in danger of passing out, talk to brother tranquillity again. he'd like to get the monks' brains back in their bodies where they belong. unfortunately, as you're all too well aware by now, you're no brain surgeon, but luckily, you know someone who is. travel todr fenkenstrain's abode, which is directly north-east of the canifis lodestone, and meet up with him on the2ndfloor[uk]3rdfloor[us]. after a slew of requests, insults and negotiations, he eventually agrees that a new home free of the threat of being eaten sounds better than his current position. however, he doesn't want to risk being taken as game while walking to there, and is weirdly also allergic to teleportation, so you must find some other way to get him to harmony island. the doctor suggests speaking torufusabout his meat delivery crates. head tocanifisand talk to rufus, the owner of the meat store north of the bank. make sure to be wearing thering of charoswhen talking to him, and have two open inventory slots. he'll agree to let you use a crate and will give you 6crate partsto build it, but you have to fill it yourself. he'll also need to check the quality of your 'product' to make sure it's worth carrying in one of his boxes and for this purpose, he gives you awolf whistleto contact him. since he assumes you'll be transporting cats, you need to construct 10wooden catsto fill the crate and avoid suspicion. a cutscene will ensue where your player character wonders where they can get some cats before seeing aplayer spoofwalking with a clockwork cat, then getting the idea to make wooden cats themselves. do not remove the ring of charos or drop the wolf whistle, as these will be used to summon rufus and influence him to your liking. if you plan to make your own wooden cats, bring 10 wooden planks and 10 pieces of fur to acrafting tablein your or your friend's house and craft 10 wooden cats. travel back to fenkenstrain's castle with all of the required items. when you get to the doctor, you'll see a hotspot to build the crate. do so, then use the extra (4)  planks of wood to build a false bottom. finally, fill it with fake cats and use the wolf whistle to call rufus;

they only drop as many as you need of each item. make sure you are not currently in a group. if you are you will not receive any of the surgical equipment. with the items, go back to the granary and hand them over to dr fenkenstrain to begin the gruesome surgery. the surgery scene is cut out and instead, you see a kitten playing with a redball of wool. after the successful surgery, go upstairs and talk to brother tranquillity. now that the monks are back where they belong, it's time to end this once and for all. grab all the armour, food and potions you'll need for the upcoming fight (lvl 93) – do not bring a helmet or cape, since you still need to wear your diving suit. note: you will be prevented from equipping anything after leaving the monk's mill (all equipment slots, not just head and cape) and will instead receive this message: ""you cannot wear that without the gas affecting you"" walk through the demolished front door of the monastery to find that the sorebones are missing, for now. onlymi-gorwill be standing there, giving you the option to ""confront"" him. when you do, he'll sic his monstrosity on you – a giant mess of machinery namedbarrelchest. if you log out or teleport away during the battle, barrelchest will be at full health again when you return. should you die, your gravestone will be placed outside the monastery door. the use of abilities can make this fight significantly easier; players with combat level 70 or above should be able to defeat the barrelchest easily with decent weapons and food. it will both disrupt your prayers and lower your prayer points. onesuper defence potionor two regular defence potions, and one prayer potion should be enough to counteract the lowering attacks. after killing barrelchest, pick up theanchorthat drops and walk back to the windmill to inform brother tranquillity of your victory. the great brain robbery is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

fierce battles with giant beasts; striding boldy[sic]to rescue a dwarf in distress! not a quest for the meek or faint-hearted, prepare yourself for a feast of fairytale fun with rewards a-plenty! the brothers grimm could never have foretold a tale such as this... talk tosylas, who can be found west offaladorand south oftaverley, at his farming plot just north of thewitch's house. sylas, a collector by profession, is in possession of some ""magic beans"", which he is willing to part with if you can bring him a couple of ""trinkets"" for his collection. from sylas, head to the white wolf mountain; grimgnash is located on the north-east corner. the apparently angry griffin says that it cannot get to sleep because of the howling wolves, and demands a bedtime story from you, failing which he would eat the player. if grimgnash doesn't like the story, he will attack you and deal 1,000-1,500 life points of damage. grimgnash says he loves stories with death, fire and destruction. proceed to narrate to him a bedtime story by selecting the options which sound the most violent (the numbers in brackets are for those controlling the dialogue using the keyboard): at this point, you can answer with any of the remaining choices. once grimgnash is asleep, steal a feather from the pile next to his nest. next, travel to the tower between thegoblin villageandice mountainusing agoblin village sphereor using some other form of travel. if you attempt to get in by the door of the tower,miazrqawill stop you. in order to locate rupert, you will need to go around to the back and climb over the crumbling wall (requires 58thieving). once inside the compound, talk into the pipe and you will find thatrupert the beardhas actually been imprisoned at the top of the tower. talk to rupert to find out how to get up the tower, and he suggests climbing up is the only viable option. ask if there is anything up there that would help and he will throw down his beard. climbing up the beard requires level 59agility(as does climbing back down). rupert explains to you his plight - his gnome friend,winkin, disappeared when he was delivering ogleroots to the market indraynor village. when he asked around, he found that winkin was last seen talking to a witch. on still further investigations, he came upon miazrqa, the arrogant princess outside the tower; as it turns out, miazrqa is related to the witch last seen with the gnome. rupert admits to flirting with the princess to pry information out of her, but that when invited back to her tower, she slammed the door shut behind him, locking him in. and so, regrettably, he cannot give you his helmet as the princess has stolen all his armour. rupert asks you to talk to the princess and convince her to release him. climb down the tower using the dwarf's beard and talk to miazrqa. she will ask how you know the witch, who is miazrqa's second cousin, twice removed. miazrqa will chide you for guessing if you answer incorrectly, but this does not affect progress. she says that she will happily release the dwarf if you can returnher pendant, stolen by a mouse in thewitch's house, south of taverley.  ask the princess for ahouse keyin order to enter her cousin's house (or, if you forget, you can look under the potted plant near the door, for a key to the house). go to the basement of the witch's house. make sure you are wearing a pair of leather gloves, so as to avoid an electric shock from the gate and lose 20% of your max life points. open the cage door and search the music stand to find amusic sheet. read it carefully, as you have to play the notes on the piano nearby. the notes ""efedc"" are played on the right hand (upper) side and the notes ""aega"" are played on the left hand (lower) side. once you successfully play the melody, a compartment will open revealing three items in it - ashrinking potion recipe, a'to do' listand 2shrunk ogleroots. read the recipe to mix a shrinking potion - use a clean tarromin with a vial of water and complete it by adding the ogleroot. make 2 shrink-me-quick potions now, as you will need one later in the quest. with the potions made, go back up to the small room leading into the garden. drink one potion while standing next to the 'witch glyph' on the wall, near the mouse hole. due to the potion and the glyph's magical properties, the player will suddenly shrink and enter in the mouse hole. if you lose the shrunk ogleroot or waste a potion, you can go down themanholejust outside the entrance to the witch's house and kill anexperiment no.2, which will always drop one; they also commonly dropgrimy tarromin. there are aggressivemicein themouse hole. make sure you have prayer and/or good food just in case. also, be sure to bring a teleport of some sort, or if you want to use the home teleport, there is a safe spot behind the rock where you find the pendant. do not attempt to go through the grates as this will cause you to leave, voiding the glyph's magic. to avoid getting lost, follow these directions: from here, you can teleport out by using agoblin village sphereor some other form of teleportation. if using a lodestone, you can either kill the nearby mouse or go behind the rock that the pendant was on. alternatively you can backtrack out the way you came in and you will revert to regular size as you exit the mouse hole. take the pendant back to miazrqa, who keeps her promise and releases the dwarf. fumbling with his armour, rupert finally manages to exit the tower. as a token of thanks, he offers you hisspecial helmet. travel back tosylasand give him rupert's helmet, along with the griffin feather. you realise that sylas is actually interested in some bigger fish. in exchange for the beans which, in fact, are not magical, he wants you to get one final piece of collectable for him - a golden goblin. legends speak of a tribe of goblins that discovered an abandoned dwarf mine and decided to extract and use the ore for purposes unknown. led by a shrewd goblin namedgubblebak, the group created some of the finest smelting works. gubblebak, although a great business head, was cunning and had a pervasive affinity to gold. he eventually over-worked his goblin army into mutiny, which ended in him being thrown into a vat of molten gold. he somehow survived, only to fall into a trough of water next, causing the heated gold to solidify and effectively kill him, and create a casing around his body. the artefact is, since then, known to reside in the clouds, protected by a giant and sylas wants you to retrieve it for him. he points out to you that the reason why rupert has such a long beard is because of a special growth potion that was present in his helmet. using this potion, you may be able to access the land of the skies. take the beans and plant it in the special patch beside sylas. awatering canis required; you cannot use themagic watering canon your tool belt, or if you have one stored in atool leprechaun's inventory, one can be found at the north-east tree patch in taverley, or you can purchase one at afarmingstore. after watering the patch, a cutscene plays where a giant beanstalk grows up in the place of the beans. get ready for a fight withglod, a giant. when you're ready, climb up the beanstalk. you cannot bring any familiars up the beanstalk, not even pouches in your inventory. high level players will have no difficulty with the battle. glod has no special weaknesses, but he is highly resistant to melee and range. using magic attacks to defeat glod is advised; if you have access to level 50 weaponry, it should be fairly easy to dispatch him. glod, a cloud giant, will attack you immediately. due to his prayer disabling abilities, he is much more difficult than his level suggests. he can also drain prayer too, up to 500 points at a time, hence a prayer potion might be necessary. he will sometimes taunt you, causing your character to attack him head on. he may also quake the ground, hitting you hard and draining your prayer. if you haveancient magicks, you can freeze glod and not have to worry about having to hide. glod may also heal himself during the battle, therefore you should keep attacking him whenever you can, in order to defeat him as quickly as possible. for melee: if you stand next to a jutting rock, with glod facing you semi-diagonally (which happens naturally), his ""run-away"" taunt will not have any effect. the description box will say the same thing as if you did run the approximate 4 spaces away from him, but you will stay in place and be able to attack him again faster. the southernmost rock on the west side works best, as you enter the floating cloud island right next to it. once you defeat glod, he'll drop the golden goblin along with two sets ofbig bones, anuncut ruby, anuncut sapphire, and awatering can. take the golden goblin back to sylas, who also requests you to chop the beanstalk down, in case someone plans to seek revenge for glod. use a shrinking potion on the beanstalk to activate the glyphs where you fought glod and shrink the beanstalk, then take a hatchet and chop it down. go back to sylas again for your reward. grim tales is not currently required for any quests or miniquests."

in a sand pit. it is notable for having lots of puns and jokes in its dialogue. travel toyanille(use fairy ring codeciqor home teleport spell with active yanille lodestone to get there quickly), and talk tobert. he can be found at the house next to the sand pit, east of thehouse portal. he tells you that he found a hand buried in the sand. ask him why he hasn't told the authorities. he says the captain is drunk most of the time and asks for help. agree to give him a hand, and bert gives you thesandy hand. he suggests that the smelly hand will get the guard captain's attention. go to the sandpit located northwest of his house to fill the bucket for later use. dash over to thedragon innto the south and talk to the drunkguard captain. give him a beer, and he takes a gulp and then asks what you want. tell him about the hand bert found. wade through a rambling conversation with the captain and then give him the hand. he drops it in his beer — turning it into abeer-soaked hand— gives it back, and suggests you go talk to the wizards. go to thewizards' guild(east of the inn), and ring thebellto havezavistic rarvecome out. if you already have access to the guild then you can go find him upstairs. talk to him about the hand, and ask if all his wizards are accounted for. after examining the hand, he tells you that this is the hand ofclarence, one of his apprentices. he asks you to help and find out why bert's been working long hours. return to bert's home, and talk to him again. he tells you he works forsandy's sand corp, based inbrimhaven. he gives you a copy of hisscheduleand tells you that it hasn't changed recently—or so he thinks. head tosandyin brimhaven. a quick way to get there is the karamja lodestone and walk north. sandy is located in the office just north-west of thedead man's chestbar and south-east ofscarface pete's mansion. talk to him first if you want — he acts a bit brusque if you do — but you don't need to. search sandy's desk in the office to getsandy's rota. read it, and compare it tobert's rotato see that bert has indeed been working longer hours. while you're there, pickpocket sandy. it may take multiple attempts before you find a small amount ofsandin his pocket. keep it, because it will become important later on in the quest, when you need to speak withbetty. make your way back tobertin yanille, and talk to him. tell him his hours did indeed change a week ago, but bert has no memory of it. he wonders if the wizards at the guild might be responsible for his memory loss and mentions a scroll that appeared a week ago. you ask if you can take a look at thescroll. it appears normal, but do not throw it out. if you brought a bucket instead of a bucket of sand, fill it at the sand pit. head back to the wizards guild, talk tozavistic rarve, and show him the scroll. rarve tells you the scroll is used in a mind-altering spell. he gives you amagical scrying orb, and tells you to get sometruth serumfrombettyfound at the magic shop in north westport sarim. you will then be ready to ask sandy a few questions. grab avial,redberries,whiteberries, and a (bullseye)lantern lens. either make your own way tobetty's magic emporiumin port sarim or take the items plus a second empty vial back tozavistic rarveand he will teleport you directly to betty's shop. talk to betty and give her an empty vial. she gives you back abottled waterand instructs you how to make arose-tinted lens. add redberries to the water to makeredberry juice, and then addwhite berriesto makepink dye. once made, use it on your lantern lens to craft a rose-tinted lens. talk to betty again. then, stand in her open doorway and use your lens on her counter to make the truth serum. talk to betty again, who says you need something personal from sandy or else the serum won't work. you hand betty the sand you found in sandy's pocket, and she sprinkles it in the serum, which fizzes. she recommends you dilute the serum in something liketeaor coffee or else bad things might happen, such as ""bits might drop off."" betty can replace the truth serum if lost, but will require more sand to do so. the cheapest way to reach sandy would be to use the karamja lodestone and walk north. or talk tocaptain tobiasor one of his young sailors on the port sarim docks to sail tokaramjafor 30 coins, and then head west to brimhaven. you can also charter directly to brimhaven using the charter ship which is in the southernmost dock. this will cost 1600 coins or 800 with an activated ring of charos. use the serum on sandy's coffee mug, and receive a message saying you need to distract him first. talk to sandy, and select one of the astonishing options. you must have tried to put the serum in his coffee, or else sandy will say he is ""not falling for that one!"" use the serum on sandy's coffee mug while he turns to look out the window. activate yourmagical orband talk to sandy. he confesses that he changed bert's schedule and bribed a wizard to put a spell on bert so he would believe everything sandy said. he then admits to killing thewizardso he wouldn't have to pay him and putting his body in a load of sand.  return to yanille, and talk again with zavistic rarve. you hand him the orb and watch as the recording is played back. talk to him again, and tell him you've brought fiveearth runesand abucket of sand. you see a

(he will be less than friendly if you state you arezamorakianand send you away.) he divulges he is on a quest to strengthen saradomin's name in morytania, explaining that you are standing atop the now abandoned mort ridge mines that used to be exploited by the morytanians until themisthalin - morytania warand the blessing of theriver salve. the mine is also said to be the source of the legendarysalve amulet, carved from the crystals that grow within due to the blessed river water seeping through the rock. this salve amulet is said to afford its bearer power overevil, wherefore the zealot seeks to gain access to the mines and craft another. he moreover adds that the mine is haunted; it was once protected by a zamorakian mage namedtreus dayth, who was slain by saradominists that managed to make off with a shard of crystal. the livid chaos god is said to then have cursed dayth's soul and bound it to the crystals to prevent their being reached again. moreover, following this incident,the ruler of the landordered the mines to be sealed and everyone within to be slaughtered. you may ask why this happened, to which he replies that the miners were said to be 'bestowed with the love of saradomin' simply by being in the crystals' presence. rather than risk losing their workforce to the saradominists, the morytanians brutally killed them. the victims' souls are now rumoured to haunt the mine. ask about other entrances into the mine. the zealot confirms a second entrance may exist by discreetly asking around and has come into possession of a key granting access to the lower levels of the mine. if you ask how one so clearly aligned to saradomin managed to remain discreet, he will angrily remark that his god watches over him and there are many to take his place should he fall. he concludes he would rather be murdered whilst proclaiming saradomin's goodness than hide his faith. he is still trying to work out where the second entrance may be, but remarks it was not made for humans. ask him whether you may borrow the key; he refuses, saying the mission can only be entrusted to himself. no matter how much you attempt to persuade him, he will not part with the key.pickpockethim to gethis key, which is needed later in the quest. do not forget to get this, or you will have to come back for it later. you can get another if you lose the key, or multiples with thedrop trick. walk south of the unfortunate cleric to the cart track; do not descend the stone stairs for you will be met by locked doors. beware of theferal vampyreson the prowl. climb over the second-to-last cart, then walk past the last cart and crawl through the cart tunnel. if you don't have 15 agility to climb over the cart, go to the west side of the mountain instead and enter the southern entrance. you find yourself in a dark cave with many bats big and small and many pickaxes and corpses strewn about. some skeletons are dormant; the ones calledcorpsesin yellow letters spring alive asskeletal minerswhen you approach. similarly, some pickaxes may becomepossessedand attack you when you pick them up. throughout the mine, you will also encounter many creepyhazes. they are spooky but harmless, although they can sometimes turn into aggressiveghostswhen adjacent. your task is to make your way to the depths of the caves and find the salve crystal. make sure to avoid any mine carts moving on their own accord; they will damage you if you get in their way. you'll arrive at the entrance to the first level (1), which has two ladders that lead deeper into the mines. the first ladder (2) is not yet of interest, and the path to the second ladder (4) is blocked by obstructions. go west past the first ladder and crawl through the cart tunnel to exit the cave out of the mine. on the surface, follow the road (3) marked by a visible track and re-enter the mine. once inside, head east and go down ladder 4. you'll find yourself at the south-western ladder (4). simply walk east and head down the nearby ladder (6). from the eastern-most ladder (6), head west and south along the tracks, while being wary of the haunted cart (g). if the cart hits you, you'll be damaged and pushed back to the beginning of the cart's path. naturally, you can use the alcoves beside the tracks as safe spots to avoid the cart. once across, head down the ladder (12) to level 4. level 4 of the mine has several key elements, which are marked on the map as: to access the deepest and darkest levels of the mine, you need to use theglowing fungusfound on this level as a light source. unfortunately, the path to reach the lowest level involves going back up to the surface, and daylight exposure causes the fungi to crumble to ashes instantly. your only option is to use a complicated system of operational carts to transport the fungi to the other side of the blockades found on level 3. pick up a few glowing fungus (j) and place one in the southernmost cart (k). you must now make use of the points settings (l), which display a track map, to operate the cart system and move the fungus to the desired spot, marked by ladders on the top-right of the map. pressing the red start button will set the cart system in motion. the objective is to get the cart from the start position on the left to the exit point at the ladder in the top right corner (north-west). if you fail, you can simply retry but you will need to replace the fungus. the map also shows two groups of levers controlling the junctions, marked with letters. the levers a through e are south-east of the control panel, whereas f through j are north, around the corner. examining them reveals to which they correspond. beware of skeletal miners lying in ambush at both stations. in order to get the cart towards the correct exit, study the route map carefully. the levers f, g and hcannotbe pulled, as they are inaccessible. these junctions are therefore fixed, limiting your options. the cart will follow the (bright)crimsonroute at any junction when approaching from the tail direction of the corresponding arrow. pulling the respective lever exchanges the (bright) crimson and (dull) burgundy arrows at the junction. when approaching a junction from the arrow head's direction, its orientation (i.e. colour) does not matteras long as it is a straight path. in order to round a corner and not plunge into a wall or the water, the direction taken by the cart must be marked by a crimson arrow. the east set of levers the north set of levers the desired track map the starting position of the points levers (arrows on the map) varies between players, so the levers that need to be pulled will differ based on this. pull whichever levers need to be changed in order to match the 'desired track map' above. check that the points settings map matches this before proceeding. once you have loaded the fungus and set the right path, press 'start' on the track map. if you've done this correctly, a dialogue box will appear where you wonder whether the cart ended up anywhere useful. if you end up sinking your cart, you must place another glowing fungus in it. to reach the fungus, you need to go back up to level 1 by using the ladders 12, 6, and 4 on levels 4, 3, and 2 respectively (reversing the route you took with with the ladders previously). exit the cart tunnel to the west and re-enter the cart tunnel to the north (again, reversing the previous route) to enter the northern section of level 1. alternatively, usedrakan's medallionto teleport back to burgh de rott, then hop over the fence and enter the mine the way you did initially to put you just east of ladder 2 on level 1. if the cart is empty, you made a mistake at the track map. you must go back to the cart system, load a new fungus, and repeat the entire process. don't lose or drop the fungus until you have completed the quest (it will disintegrate if you do and you shall have to obtain another)! head all the way east past the ladder going up and then south past a moving cart (g). climb down the ladder (9) to end up in a side cave east of the flooded tracks on level 4. make sure that you are not on the west side of the ladder when you climb down or else you will not be able to walk past the ladder on the lower level. if this does happen, ascend the ladder and climb down it again from a different side. head south down the corridor. there is a water-powered lift (13) going further down but it isn't working. there is a water valve (p) next to it, at the other side of a large pipe, which requires turning in order to power the lift. locate the water valve and attempt to turn it; it's locked but there is a small keyhole in its side. use thezealot's keyon the valve to activate the water flow from the nearby basin. make sure you have sufficientrun energybefore heading back to the lift, for amischievous ghostwill appear and try to shut off the valve before you can reach the lift. run quickly around the water pipe system to the lift and go down to the fifth level. if the ghosts beats you, simply turn the valve again and retry. the lift remains operational after the initial activation, so the zealot's key is no longer needed. after you've gone down the lift, you will find yourself in a vast water-filled chamber that extinguishes all light sources except the glowing fungus. to go back up, simply click on the lift and you will automatically swim towards it. from the flooded chamber, walk south onto the track (beware of possessed pickaxes) and follow it to theeast. (the western corridor leads to a locked door that you cannot open yet.) proceed down the staircase (14) to descend to the 6th level. once down these stairs, head west and through the door to reach a room full of loading cranes and mine carts. with theglowing fungus, the cave will be properly lit. at the centre of the room, try to pick up theinnocent-looking key(t).treus dayth, now turned into a ghost, will ambush you and possess the machinery in there to damage you if you get too close. the mine carts will knock you down, rapidly damaging you, if you get in their path and the cranes will hit fairly hard if you stand on a tile adjacent to them. treus must be killed to proceed. he appears at different locations in the room, and each hit to his visible form will cause him to flee to the next location. you can view his movements through a flashing yellow arrow on your screen. during his flight, he'll conjure pickaxes and throw them at you. switching tolegacy combat modemay help lower-levelled players. dying to treus dayth will turn the glowing fungus into ashes, requiring you to repeat the whole process. after defeating treus dayth, pick up theinnocent-looking key(which turns into acrystal-mine key). you can add it to yoursteel key ringif you've completedone small favour. level 5 of the abandoned mine level 6 of the abandoned mine with the key in possession, walk back through the door and up the stairs you used to enter the level (14) and head all the way west to the other staircase (15). descend and go a short way east to a set of doors. use thecrystal-mine keyto open the door (u) and go south-east to find the salvecrystal outcrops(y). simply click on any one of them to cut a piece and obtain asalve shard. congratulations, quest complete! haunted mine is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

amahjarrat, and introduceshazeel, azamorakianmahjarrat that has been put into a state of torpor, and his followers are attempting to revive him in time for the nextritual of rejuvenation. this quest is fairly unique in that it has two sides, a ""good"" side and an ""evil"" side, sharing this trait withtemple of ikov, another mahjarrat quest. in the ""good"" side, the player foils the cultists in their attempt to resurrect hazeel, and in the ""evil"" side, the player joins the cult and assists them in resurrecting hazeel. decide for yourself whether to aid the carnilleans in retrieving stolen goods, or join the hazeel cult members in their mission to resurrect the infamous lord hazeel. unlike most quests, this quest has two paths through it, one where you foil the cultists in their plot to revive hazeel, and another where you become a member of the cult and assist them in reviving hazeel. assisting the carnillean family means you will have to defeat a level 9 enemy, and you have the chance to obtain some unique armour, whereas assisting the cultists has no such fight, but allows you access to a unique necklace, and also allows hazeel to appear in theritual of the mahjarratquest. to begin the quest speak to sirceril carnillean, located in his house just south of theardougne castle. he will be complaining about the ""blooming cultists"" that won't leave him alone. ask him what's wrong, and he will tell you that a ""crazy cult"" have been repeatedly breaking into his house, stealing a suit of armour when they first broke in months ago, but not having taken anything since. he will then introduce himself, and requests your assistance in returning the armour, promising to reward you if you do. accept the quest, and he will tell you to start looking by the cave entrance to the southeast, as that's where his old butlerhigsononce followed them, before dying in his sleep the next day. you will choose your side after speaking to clivet. however, it is possible to set the valves for the sewer on your way to the cultist's cave. this can save quite a few steps. details are after the chat with clivet below. from ceril's house, walk south and cross the bridge. go past the clock tower, then go east until you find a cave, just behind the clock tower. enter it, and you will encounter a man known asclivet. talk to clivet, and he will proceed to tell you that sir ceril and the rest of the carnillean's are dishonourable snobs, and he will ask if you wish to learn the truth. ask him what he means, and he will tell you that the carnillean home does not belong to them, and that it was built by lordhazeel, a zamorakian mahjarrat warlord. he goes on to say that many years ago, saradominists declared war upon all zamorakians, including hazeel, and that one night, led by sir ceril's ancestor, they stormed hazeel's home, torturing and butchering all zamorakians inside, before proceeding to move into the house the following morning. clivet then goes on to say that, unluckily for them, hazeel made preparations for his return when they first stormed his home, and that soon the day will come when hazeel will return and have his vengeance. after you say that politics do not concern you, and that you have a job to fulfil, clivet will offer you a new job, and requests that you join the cult and assist in restoring hazeel, promising that you will be bestowed with treasures if you do so. you now have a choice to eitherhelp the cultists, orhelp the carnillean family. say that you will never help them, and clivet will call you a fool before escaping on a raft. if you have not already diverted all the valves and you attempt to board the raft now, you will find that the currents of the water are blocking it. you will need to find fivesewer valvesand turn them in the proper directions to redirect the currents, allowing you to proceed to the cult's hideout. head outside the cave, and you will find that the sewer valves are all nearby. the valves only have one option, which is to be turned in the opposite direction to the one they are currently in, and all of the valves are currently in the wrong directions. so you will merely have to turneach valve once(right-click). after all five valves have been turned, board the raft in clivet's cave. it will deposit you at the cult's hideout. from the raft, head south into the hideout's main chamber, where you will find the leader of the cultists,alomone. he can be identified by the fact he is the only cultist with a staff. talk to alomone, and he will be shocked at how you have managed to gain access to the hideout. you will demand the armour back, and he will explain that he thought he made it clear to the butler to make it so you would not interfere with the mission, calling him an incompetent fool. you will thank him for telling you that the butler is part of the cult, and he will proceed to say that you won't live long enough to tell anyone, and attacks you. alomone is level 9, and attacks with melee by bashing you with his staff. he is extremely weak, so most players should have no trouble killing him. once he is defeated, he will drop ceril'scarnillean armour. if you want to keep a set of the carnillean armour for yourself, wait for alomone to respawn, drop the armour, and kill him again, picking up the extra set of armour. make sure to drop it before you next talk to ceril, or he will take both sets.  take the armour back to ceril carnillean, and you will tell him that you killed the cult leader and retrieved his armour. he will take the armour and thank you, saying that before he rewards you he will have jones make up a batch of his special broth, which causes you to tell him that you found out that jones is in league with the cultists. angered, he will summon butler jones and tells him that you say he had something to do with the theft of the armour, and asks for him to explain himself. butler jones, of course, denies any involvement, and ceril will believe him, calling you a scoundrel for accusing jones of such a crime without any evidence. ceril will take the armour from you, and agrees to reward you, but, due to the accusations made against jones, he will have to compensate him. you will receive 5 coins, with jones receiving 1,995 as compensation, and ceril will once again call you a scoundrel, telling you to leave and to never come back. you are not done yet! read below. for ceril to believe your accusations about jones, you will need to find some evidence that links him to the cultists. head upstairs, and search the wardrobe in the master bedroom for evidence. a cutscene begins where you find a bottle of poison andhazeel's mark. you summon ceril and show him the bottle of poison. still not believing you, he once again summons butler jones, who claims it to be mere ""rat poison"". however, you then show ceril the mark of hazeel, and carnillean will finally believe you, recognising the amulet as being worn by the thieves that broke in. jones will confess, calling ceril a senile old fool, and says that he should have killed him and his family weeks ago. ceril will then summon a guard, who arrests jones for attempted murder and burglary. jones promises to return, saying that this is not the last you have heard of him, and that ceril's family will pay dearly, although the guard merely states that there will be no revenge where he's going: a secure jail cell. ceril, thanking you and apologising for his earlier behaviour, finally rewards you. congratulations, quest complete! jones is finally found out, and calls ceril a fool. jones promises to one day return, promising to have his revenge. the guard arrests jones, promising him a nice and secure jail cell. agree to join. clivet will give you a bottle ofpoisonin order to perform your task, telling you to pour it onto the carnillean's food and to return to him once the deed is done. return to ceril's house and climb down the ladder, which will grant you access to the kitchen. use the bottle of poison that he gave you on the range, and you will pour the poison into the pot atop it, causing the poison to dissolve into the soup. head back upstairs, and, if you wish, talk to the carnilleans, who will reveal that their dog is dead. head back to clivet, and you will inform him that the deed is done. he will tell you that they heard all about it from one of their sources, and that things did not go plan, as the soup was not eaten by one of the carnilleans, and was instead fed to their dogscruffybyphilipe carnillean. nevertheless, as you have proven your loyalty to them, he will give you amark of hazeel, which identifies you as a cult member and acts as the ""key"" to their hideout, explaining that the sewer can only be accessed if the flow of the sewer is controlled exactly the right way by turning thesewer valvesin the correct direction, and that by following the design of the amulet from left to right, you will be able to locate each sewer valve and turn each as to follow the amulet design. by turning the valves the correct way, you will be able to gain access to the cult's hideout, and be able to meet their leader,alomone. if not already done, you need to find five sewer valves and turn them in the proper directions to redirect the currents, which will allow the raft to proceed to the cult's hideout. the valves can be found in the following locations: after the valves are turned in the correct direction, board the raft in clivet's cave to travel to the cult's main hideout. head south from the raft and talk toalomone, the cult's leader and the only member besides clivet with a staff. alomone will explain that clivet had told him you wished to assist in reviving hazeel, and that to do this, they require ancient words that, when spoken, are capable of restoring hazeel's weakened body. hazeel, anticipating that he would one day be defeated, hid amagical scrollwith these words written on in his house, which is now under the ownership of the carnilleans', right under their noses. he will explain that while they already have an agent in the house, he has so far been unsuccessful in locating the scroll, and requests that you head back into the mansion and assist him with finding it. head back to the carnilleans' mansion, and talk to their agent,butler jones. you will ask jones if he has any idea where the scroll is, and he explains that while he knows its somewhere in the house, he has searched high and low and has been unable to find it. head down the ladder to the basement once again, and search the crates there for achest key, and then head back up the ladder and head up the stairs to the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]. in the northwest (philipe's) room, you will find an odd wall. knock it and you will enter a small room. climb up the ladder in the room and you will find a small chest. use the key to unlock the chest and you will receive thehazeel scroll. head back into the cultist's hideout and talk to alomone, and you will hand him the scroll, which alomone claims will be able to return his lord and bring destruction to his enemies. alomone advises you to watch hazeel's glorious return, and begins chanting in a strange language, which causes hazeel to emerge from his coffin. hazeel claims to have pride in his followers for their efforts, claiming to not have ever expected to return, and claims to have much to attend to, explaining that soon the world will once again cower at his name, with his fury blazing across his enemies, while his followers are rewarded. hazeel then speaks to you directly, thanking you for your service, and saying that while you may not be a direct follower of zamorak, your cunning and treachery mark you as a friend of the mahjarrat, explaining that soon his strength will return, and that his followers will be greatly rewarded when his powers peak once more. you will interrupt him, asking for your reward now, and hazeel, claiming that your insolence will be overlooked just this once as he is in your debt, hands you some ancient coins, although he also says that your true reward will come later, when you are spared as an ally when he and zamorak lay waste to the world. hazeel then teleports away, explaining that he is now heading north in order to join his fellow mahjarrat and regain his strength and powers, saying that he will return when he is ready to fight his enemies. congratulations, quest complete! alomone reads the scroll hazeel is revived! hazeel heads tothe north hazeel cult is directly

bring theabyssinto gielinor, and it is up to anotherheroto stop her, with the aid of a rune golem created byariane. the quest leads the heroes through sites connected with the elder gods, and is the beginning of unlocking their mysteries. to start, interact withxeniaandarianenear the entrance door of thewizards' tower. if you cannot accept the quest, you can log out and back in again to fix it. accept the quest and a cutscene will occur where ariane is not letting xenia pass because she has murderedpablo corvusa, an innocent man. pick either option (side with ariane, xenia, or break them both up). the choice does not matter, but it does have an effect on the golem later in the quest. xenia finally stops ariane, and teleports away. meet ariane at the old tower, on the east side of the wizards' tower island, and south-east of the beginning of the quest. she will explain that you need to track down xenia with her, using the help of the kinaesthetic investigation programmable personality lifeform emulator, orkipplefor short. kipple is designed to adapt to any challenges it faces and will be used to track xenia down. talk to kipple and use the runic frequency modulator. the idea of the runic frequency modulator is to rotate the discs of six runes to find a frequency, which is indicated as a red dot bouncing up and down on the chart - right side of the display screen. the values are different for everyone. once a signal is found, you'll have to rotate the discs to fit the height of the lit-up rune columns to match with the height of the frequency in each position, until it tells you a match has been found. the chart corresponds to the values the runes on each wheel are in. the innermost rune on each disk is worth 3 points (inner most circle), the two on each side of that are worth 2 points (second inner circle), and the remaining ones on the outer edge are worth one point. for example, a fire rune in the outermost circle (1 point) plus a fire rune in the innermost circle (3 points) equals a value of 4 on the chart. a good strategy is to narrow down how the wheels can be situated to match a single rune, and then brute force through the remaining combinations. for example, if you need a cosmic rune score of three, there are two cosmic runes in the puzzle so one of them must be in a ""1"" position and one must be in a ""2"" position. that alone reduces the number of possible combinations by a factor of three. another (easier) strategy, is to change combinations until you see the red dot move along the runes. when you see the red dot go high on a bar, that means that the runes are required to be turned until the bar matches the red dot. when you have an idea for each column, tuning the golem should be relatively easy. for those finding it difficult to follow the red dot, you can also brute force the puzzle. this is done by leaving one dial at one rune, leaving the second dial at one rune, then switching through all 6 runes on the last dial. after you've done that, you switch to a new rune on the second dial and repeat and when you've done all the runes on the second dial you switch to a new rune on the first dial and repeat the process again. this method will take slightly longer though, as there are 216 possibilities. find a match and follow the signal. there are four signals altogether, each leading to the location of anelder god:karamja(ful),white wolf mountain(wen), andentrana(bik). when you get to each location, kipple will appear and ask you to re-tune him to locate the portal. kipple will not appear if you have a follower. the player can find a signal for ful, wen and bik in any order. deposit all combat items. food may be required for lower-level players. track combination: law, law, chaos tune combination: cosmic, mind, earth travel toentrana. kipple will join you when you arrive and will follow you like a familiar would. the portal is located on the northern half of the island, through the church and east of the dungeon. kipple will inform you when you get close to the correct spot, and you'll have to re-tune him to open the portal tobik. once you enter the portal, try opening the bik door. kipple informs you that you've angered the mouthpiece, and enemies will appear soon. kipple will provide you 3 weapons, one for each combat style:air battlestaff,bronze dagger, and achargebow. you will be attacked by three level 35bikkra's attendants; killing one will spawn anunstable attendant. the goal is to lure these unstable attendants near kipple, so it can disarm and place them next to the bik door. when there are total of 3 unstable attendants in place, light them up to blow the door open. talk tobikkra, who speaks for bik, an elder god. speak about xenia, then select the option addressing bikkra as ""the mighty one"". he will then talk about xenia and her business around bikkra's cave. after talking with bikkra, talk to kipple, to track down the next place.  don't forget to re-arm yourself before proceeding. travel towards thekaramja volcanoand tune kipple's tracker to find the portal, just in front of the entrance to thetzhaar city. enter the portal and dialogue withfulkrawill appear. kipple will attempt to debate with fulkra while you fight level 44fulkra's attendants. as the battle progresses, patches of fire will spring up from the ground beneath you and continue to burn until the debate concludes. if using ranged or mage, it will be easier to avoid stepping on the fires, but difficult if using melee and an attendant stands on top of the fire. after a few minutes, kipple will finally have finished debating. talk to fulkra, and respond with any dialogue options. after speaking with fulkra it is time to tune kipple's tracker to find the next portal. run along the eastern path of themountain, north of thetaverleybank, and kipple will appear; re-tune the tracker to make a portal visible. this portal will teleport you to an ice chamber where you have to solve a power management puzzle. each circuit node outputs a certain amount of power, but some nodes will consume more power than they generate, causing your total units to decrease instead. the white spires will redirect power to its other pair. you need to match the number of power units by activating or deactivating the correct nodes. after solving all 4 puzzles you will be able to speak towenkra, the voice ofwen. after talking with wenkra, talk to kipple, to track down the next place.  once you have spoken to bikkra, fulkra, and wenkra, use kipple once again to find the final elder god: jas. you will be led east ofsophanemto the final elder god portal, and will findjaskrain a cave. however, she refuses to speak to you until you can prove that you are not working with xenia. you must prove your innocence. search a shelf and 20 observations will appear in your inventory. you will have to combine 2 of them to link their events together and create a combined observation. combine: after creating the combined observations above, use all of them onjaskrato trigger new dialogue. this will cause the combined observation to be consumed, except forariane and the golemandgolem and i. combine them to createunited we stand, and use it on jaskra. after the dialogue, talk to kipple near the portal, and he will offer to tune himself to find xenia, or you can do it yourself. there are other combinations that serve no purpose in convincing. the following combinations are useless: combat equipment (mage is advised) and food is highly recommended for this part. speak with kipple. conveniently, he will offer to tune himself this time, and will then tell you that the portal to xenia is in the lumbridge cemetery. this is where you will have to fight the final boss, theprehistoric abyssal. as soon as you enter the portal, a cutscene will start with xenia kneeling in front of what looks much like her portals. she will turn to you and mention how she was expecting you but is surprised you were so slow in following her. she will explain to you what she has been doing, and why she has been stealing the energy from the voices of the elder gods. xenia will go on to explain that she has seen a premonition that the elder gods will awake and destroy gielinor. ariane herself appears next to you and confronts xenia. as it turns out, xenia herself is referring to thegreat revision, the idea that the elder gods will eat all theanimaoff of gielinor and destroy all life on it. xenia is therefore trying to drain the anima herself, preventing the elder gods from awakening, but ariane argues that there will be no magic left on gielinor. eventually, whether you agree with ariane, xenia, or neither of them, ariane will proclaim her intention to kill xenia, which xenia does not believe. another cutscene will occur, in which ariane will blast xenia into the abyss, killing her. the prehistoric abyssal will then appear and attack you. as it is covered in armour, it will only take 1 damage from all attacks, and will regularly heal that damage; also, if you attack it, it will follow you around the room and try to attack with melee, so do not attack it at all. the abyssal will regularly summon an energy ball which will hit you for up to 1750 damage; run around the room to avoid it, but it will follow you, and after 10 seconds it will self-destruct. run over every area in the cavern until kipple starts detecting energy. when he is done, an abyssal anchor will spawn, and you need to attack it to destroy it. note that you do not have to destroy an anchor once it spawns, you can still run around and let kipple detect more anchors, allowing you to avoid energy balls and then destroy all anchors at once. destroy three anchors and the abyssal's armour will be destroyed. a cutscene occurs where ariane will be knocked back and kipple will be destroyed. you can now deal damage to the prehistoric abyssal. magic is strongly advised for the fight due to its weakness to air spells. melee is annoying due to knock backs, and ranged is the hardest, as having a weakness to magic means it has the most resistance to ranged. the style you use is irrelevant at higher levels, as the creature has only 12,500 life points and can be killed in just a few abilities. the abyssal uses melee and a special attack. it moves slowly, so you can run around the room and use a hit-and-run tactic to avoid damage (if using mage or ranged). while within melee range, when the abyssal knocks you back, a blue bar will appear above its head (like the adrenaline bar) and quickly fill up, and it will release a special magic attack, hitting up to 2900 damage. you can avoid this by running away from the spot you were standing on at the time the blue bar appeared. once its health reaches 3000 life points, it will start using ranged attacks and its special attack every 15 seconds. if you are not within melee range, instead of knocking you back, it will stop attacking briefly before charging up and releasing its special attack. just keep running away from the special attack and use protect from range if necessary. if you happen to die at the same time as the prehistoric abyssal, you can continue on to ariane at the wizards' tower. check the quest journal to be sure if the abyssal is defeated. as the abyssal is defeated, it will offer an ominous warning that due to xenia's actions, the elder gods have begun to wake up. speak toarianeto finish the quest. you can discuss more about xenia with her. additionally, you can ask her about each of the elder gods, including mah, whom ariane doesn't know much about. she will give you the reward and tells you to come speak to her at thewizards' tower. if you don't have the inventory space, she will give you the reward once you speak to her again. she has managed to salvage kipple's ""heart"" and together with the other wizards of the tower, she created the smaller kipple nano, which she gives to the player.  quest complete! heart of stone is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

trees, rocks, and other features are being cloned. he requests you to find these sources of energy and drain them back to rejuvenate him. although optional, you can continue to talk to v if you wish to learn more about him. go outside the cave and investigate every feature that has been duplicated: as you harvest each source of energy, you will gain insight about v's character. although he was born ""stunted and weak"", he took control of his life and eventually became a hero to his people; he ponders over whether it is a price he must pay to never have a family or settling down. he also reminisces about the gods that he had encountered and how their so-called ""good actions"" were simply detrimental to their followers. the only person he could believe in wasguthix, who only ever wanted people to take charge of their own destiny and not be oppressed through the regime of gods. return to v inside the cave, and he'll still appear to be very weak. he'll tell you that he did regain some of the energy, but it's draining out faster than he can sustain it. as he tries to convince you to travel across planes and solicit the aid of people he had helped in the past, fourdragonkinenter the cave –sakirthleads the pack, followed bystrisathandkalibath, withtarshakas their prisoner. sakirth moves to attack you with a powerful blast, but it is intercepted by v, who collapses. sakirth siphons v's energy into tarshak, which turns v into a stone statue. tarshak, now brimming with power, breaks out of his cage and proceeds to smash v into pieces, claiming the life of anotherfalse user. sakirth and tarshak argue over your fate; sakirth wishes to punish you for being an annoyance, while tarshak dismisses you as a waste of time. tarshak, being more powerful, passes the order for everyone to leave and prepare to bring down the other false users. after the cutscene is over, pass through the northern door and search v's belongings. readv's journalto locate the whereabouts of the dragonkin;

sakirth returnsthe mirrorback to its original, unknown location and the other necrosyrtes leave each other's company. you can talk to sakirth to learn about the mirror, but he will attack you and lower your life points to 10. go into the next room and jump across the stepping stones to reach the chest on the west side. you will find adragonkin key. now step into the corridor - you must pass this corridor without kalibath sensing you. if you step on a pressure pad, he will hear you and the puzzle will be reset. walk through and avoid the pressure pads until you reach the first eastern crate. push it north twice, then walk around to the middle and push the two crates north twice. push the eastern crate to the east twice, then push the northern-most crate to the west once. finally, push the crate to your south once, and walk to the door. inside the room, search the chest for adragonkin protective charmand somenotes. you must read the notes you have acquired or the grotworm staircase in the next step will not be open for you to move forward. be sure to equip the dragonkin protective charm – simply holding it in your inventory will have no effect. it must be equipped in order to significantly reduce the damage taken from the fights with tarshak. reading the notes informs you that it was written by tarshak, who plans to make sense of his condition by speaking to one of the finest dactyls –phalaks. from his notes, phalaks' lab is located somewhere inside thegrotworm lair. the easiest way to get there is by teleporting usingremora's necklace, or by teleporting to theport sarimlodestone and running north-west. go down to the bottom floor and reach the centre of the floor (west of thequeen black dragonentrance). climb down the stairs that are marked with a giant dragonkin symbol, and you will be insidephalaks' lab. a cutscene shows phalaks conversing with tarshak, who is getting riled up by phalaks' disinterest in helping him. tarshak senses your presence and the situation escalates to the point where phalaks attempts to fatally injure tarshak, but only manages to wound him. in his weakened form, you must defeat tarshak. it is a straightforward fight, although beware his special stun attack that he charges once every 10 seconds; when he channels his attack, indicated by a message in the chat box, run away from tarshak. if you remain in melee range, he will deal potentially deadly damage to you. he can be defeated with a deathtouched dart in this fight. after defeating him, tarshak retreats from the laboratory. phalaks notes that he may have gone to hissanctumsomewhere in the brimhaven dungeon. speak to phalaks for more information of his sanctum. a few easy ways to get to thebrimhaven dungeonare to use thehoardstalker ringteleport, thedungeoneering cape's teleport perk, or thekaramjalodestone teleport, and running north-west to the entrance. navigate through the dungeon to where theironandsteel dragonsare located and enter the tunnel in the west wall. if you die during the fight and wish to retrieve your items through yourgravestoneit will appear in the room with the iron and steel dragons. if your gravestone collapses fully before you retrieve your items, your items can be recovered fromdeathindeath's officewithin 24 hours of gameplay.signs of respite(i,ii,iii) may be used to increase your gravestone timer. enter the tunnel in the west wall of the cavern to meet up with tarshak, who has mutated into theabomination. there are two phases to the fight: you must do both parts without leaving the sanctum. the first phase does not allow you to directly harm tarshak. instead, you must use the environment to weaken the ceiling, and cause a collapse upon him. this is done by avoiding and surviving tarshak's attacks, and mining each of the four roof supports twice. when you've hit a pillar twice, stand next to it to attract the fireball. when the fireball destroys the weakened support, its name changes torubble. during the first phase, he has four unique attacks: in phase two, you must kill the abomination by using combat. his health will be reduced from 198,000 to 66,000 lp.  rocks will fall from the ceiling, along with fire emerging from the ground. dodging these will greatly reduce the amount of damage you take, while also damaging the abomination. like in the fight in phalaks' lab, the abomination will do a charge attack every now and then that requires you to run away from it. failing will result in you being stunned and taking a lot of damage. to make the fight easier, one strategy is to keep walking around the centre while keeping tarshak on the opposite side. the falling rocks will almost kill him. he can also be killed with a deathtouched dart in his ragged abomination form. once tarshak reaches 458 life points, he will no longer take damage from falling rocks, and you must deal the final blow yourself. after defeating the abomination, the dactyl –kerapac, phalaks, andsilkath– enter the sanctum to collect samples from tarshak's corpse. not far behind, the necrosyrtes – sakirth, strisath, and kalibath – will join them, and threaten the dactyls to help with their cause, or suffer the fate of tarshak. as the dragonkin fight amongst themselves, you manage to sneak outside. return to rellekka and speak withfreya luneoralfrick the planner, who appear to have some news for you on v's island. head over to the island to find that a part of the cave has been affectionately turned into ashrinefor their hero. freya and alfrick inform you that the fremennik and the moon clan are in your gratitude for trying to avenge v, and offer their full support in your future endeavours.  congratulations, quest complete! hero's welcome is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

quicker to teleport to theburthorpe lodestone) and speak toachiettiesstanding outside the guild. she tells you that the requirement of joining the guild is bringing her the following three items: anentranan firebird feather, a cookedlava eeland amaster thief's armband. the items can be retrieved and brought to achietties in any order. you are not required to speak with the high priest to begin searching for theice gloves– you can head directly to thewhite wolf mountain. moreover, if you already possess a pair ofice gloves, you can simply bring them to entrana, fight the firebird near the law altar, and pick up the entranan firebird feather while wearing the gloves. make sure all your armour and weapons are banked, and head toentranaby your preferred method of transportation. once there, talk to thehigh priestin the church about the firebird. according to legends, a firebird's mere touch can burn human flesh, but an ancient hero namedcamorramade use of a pair ofmagical gloves, stolen from thequeen of the ice, to catch the firebird and keep it as a pet. the priest does not know where to find the queen, as he says it is just a myth he was told as a child. however, he suggests searching for clues in thewhite wolf mountain. theice queen's lairis hidden underneath thewhite wolf mountain, located betweencatherbyandtaverley. from taverley walk up the eastern side of the mountain and enter the cave just west ofgrimgnashwhich places you on the summit near 3 trapdoors. just east of the trapdoors is a mine-able rock slide blocking the way to 3 ladders. mine it, and you will automatically walk through. the queen is relatively stronger than her combat level suggests. she has no explicit weakness and hit chance against her is unusually low, butrangedhas the best hit chance. the ice warriors are aggressive to low-level players, and attacking the ice queen will make the ice warriors aggressive regardless of level. if your prayer level is 43 or higher, usingprotect from meleewill make the fight much easier. by standing near the northern wall, you can avoid the ice warriors and still be able to attack the queen. kill her and pick up theice gloves. you may teleport out or make your way back through the dungeon and head to port sarim. with the ice gloves equipped, go toentranaand head to the northern part of the island. theentranan firebirdcan be found near thelaw altarand it has only 500 life points. simply kill the firebird and it will drop aentranan firebird feather. make sure you are wearing the ice gloves when you pick it up. the battle with the ice queen killing the entranan firebird go toport sarimand talk togerrantin hisfishing shop. ask him about catching lava eels, and he tells you that you just need a fishing rod that has a lava-proof line. this can be done by applying someblamish oilon an ordinary rod. he gives you a vial ofblamish snail slime, and tells you to mix it with a vial of water and a harralander (or aharralander potion (unf)) to obtain someblamish oil, which requires 25 herblore. buy afishing rodfrom gerrant, and right-click (to avoid accidentally drinking) and ""use"" the blamish oil on it to turn it into anoily fishing rod. if you do not have any fishing bait yet, you can buy it from gerrant or pick it up from the spawn points near the taverley dungeon entrance, if you choose to go there. lava eelfishing spots can be found in two locations: thetaverley dungeonand thelava mazein thewilderness. the taverley dungeon is reasonably safer than going to the lava maze, although it is more time consuming, unless you possess level 70agilityor amask of the black demon. the fishing spots are found after the blue dragons but before the black demons. if you already have 70 agility or a dusty key, you can skip directly to the room with theblue dragons. the taverley dungeon entrance can be found just south oftaverley. walk through the dungeon, past the skeletons, ghosts, black knights, magic axes and poison scorpions. if you have a dusty key, cross the bridge and head north until you see the lesser demons. to obtain the dusty key, go past the scorpions and continue south-west after the hill giants to enter the black knights' hideout. head south-east to the jail, kill thejailerand pick up hisjail key. open the jail cell holdingvelrak the explorerand talk to him to get a dusty key. to make getting dusty keys easier in the future, speak to him again to make him relocate to the dungeon entrance. with the key, open the door near the lesser demons and head across the room with the blue dragons, until you get to three fishing spots. use your oily fishing rod and some bait to catch someraw lava eels, which requires 53 fishing. make sure you have the oily fishing rod and some bait and head to thelava mazein thewilderness. the lava fishing spot can be found in the middle of the maze, between the first and second webs and is marked on the map with a fishing spot icon (). fish out someraw lava eels. this is easier than going through the taverley dungeon (unless you possess 70 agility), although significantly more risky. there are some aggressive level 105hellhoundsaround the spot. make sure to be opted out ofpvp(which you normally are by default) by talking tovalain order to avoid getting killed by other players. finally, once you have your eel, regardless of how you obtained it, cook it on a range or fire to get acooked lava eel, which requires 53 cooking. obtaining the master thief's armband can either be done solo or with the assistance of another player, requiring different items in each case. regardless of whether you're completing the quest solo or with a partner, you only need to complete parts related with the varrock thieves' gang that you are associated with. completing this segment of the quest with a partner may be easier, unless you have a highthievinglevel (50+ recommended). to find out what gang you are in, you can simply check your quest log for theshield of arravquest. alternatively, you can speak to eitherkatrine(black arm gang) orstraven(phoenix gang) in varrock. if you are not part of their gang, they will ask if you'd like to change gangs. players can freely change gangs before or after the quest, and other players can help you even if they have already finished heroes' quest. you may choose to do the quest with the help of a partner from the opposite gang. finding a partner might be easier on world 100 (group questing), or through the many questing clans who offer help to those in need of a partner. buying the required quest item from other players without completing the quest sections will not allow you to progress in the quest. head to theblack arm gang's hideout in south-westernvarrock. speak tokatrineabout becoming a master thief, and she'll tell you about the highly secure artefacts inbrimhaven, one of which is held by the pirate leader,scarface pete. if you want the armband, you must stealpete's candlesticksand bring it back to her. you can use the help of your fellow gang members in brimhaven, by using the password, ""four leaved clover"". go to brimhaven and try to enter the gang office, located just east of the bar, butgruborwill stop you. simply say the password to be let in. once inside, talk totrobertto become acquainted with the plan. apparently, one of the keys to pete's treasure room is withgrip, pete's head guard. grip is hiring a new deputy named hartigan, a rogue black knight looking to join the pirates. the gang has managed to ambush the knight and steal hisid papers, and are waiting for someone to fill the position. agree to the plan and take the papers from trobert. equip theblack armour setand walk to pete's mansion, the large building in the north-west part of the town. showgarvthe papers and he will let you inside. go talk to grip inside and ask him about your duties and whether there's anything to be done. he asks you to find the purpose of one of the mansion's keys; you must give themiscellaneous keyto your phoenix gang partner. go into the north-east room and wait for your partner to assume their place in the neighbouring east-side room. once they are, search the wall cabinet; grip will then come into the room, yelling at you to stop rummaging through his stuff. shut the door as soon as he enters the room, so that he stays in long enough for your partner to kill him. after he is dead, pick upgrip's key. go to the treasure room in the north-west part of the mansion and use grip's key to open the door. search thechestand take the twocandlesticks. leave the mansion and give the extra candlestick to your partner. go back to varrock and talk to katrine to become a master thief and receive themaster thief's armband. speak to grip, then go directly to the treasure room in the north-west part of the mansion and use a lockpick or hair clip on the door – you may fail and break the lockpick. search thechestand take the twocandlesticks(you only require one of them). leave the mansion, head back to varrock and talk to katrine to become a master thief and receive themaster thief's armband. head to thephoenix gang hideoutin southernvarrockand talk tostraven. he tells you to steal the much-covetedcandlesticks, belonging to the pirate leaderscarface pete, and stored in his mansion inbrimhaven. he also tells you to take help of the phoenix gang associates in brimhaven –charlie the cookandalfonse the waiter– by using the password, ""gherkin"". travel to theshrimp and parrotfood shop in brimhaven, located north of the pub, and talk to alfonse about 'gherkins'. he tells you to go around in the back and speak to charlie. charlie will tell you that they haven't made great progress in retrieving the candlesticks, however, they have figured out a way to enter the mansion undetected. take themiscellaneous keyfrom your black arm gang partner and go through the secret wall panel between the door and the stove, and into the yard. run past theguard dogsand enter the mansion through the side door with some barrels next to it. once inside, use the miscellaneous key on the north door to get into a room with a cross-shaped window. your partner should be standing there besidegrip; wield your ranged or magic weapon and shoot/cast at grip through the hole in the west wall. once dead, he will drop his keys for your partner to pick up, who will obtain two candlesticks and trade you one of them. once you have spoken to charlie, you will be able to bribe the guardgarvwith 1000 coins, or alternatively, wear thering of charos (a)andgarvwill trust you to enter the mansion west of the food shop. go to the treasure room in the north-west part of the mansion and use a lockpick or hair clip on the door – you may fail and break the lockpick. search the chests and take the twocandlesticks(you only require one of them). leave the mansion, head back to varrock and talk to straven to become a master thief and receive themaster thief's armband. go back to theheroes' guildwith the three items and talk toachietties, make sure to have 9 free inventory spaces. she will accept them and welcome you into the guild. congratulations, quest complete! heroes' quest is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

to help the king, you must travel to hisrealmusing amagic whistle. the crone says that the whistle can be found in""a haunted manor house inmisthalin"", although you need an object from the realm to be able to see it. since the fisher realm is a reality different from this one, you need to blow the whistle at the point where it's easiest to cross through. the specific location is found by triangulating the directions in which the 4mysterious statuesface. the 4 statue locations are as follow: east of theseers' villagebank, south of thefishing guild, north of thetower of life, and west of the brimhavenpohportal. make your way tosir galahad, located in a building west ofseers' villageandmcgrubor's woodand east of thecoal trucks, and talk to him. tell him you're on a quest for the holy grail, on which he reminisces. ask him why he left, and after some more nostalgia, he reluctantly gives you aholy table napkin, a souvenir he took from the fisher realm. now head to the top floor of thedraynor manorand into the southern room. pick up bothmagic whistleson the table – they are only visible when you walk into the room with theholy table napkinin your possession. there is a bug that prevents the whistles from spawning while carrying the holy table napkin. have theexcalibur, magic whistle, a weapon, armour, and some food with you. head to where the stone faces point, which is under a tower on the north-west part ofbrimhaven. stand under the watchtower and blow the whistle to be teleported to thefisher king's realm. you find yourself in a gloomy, mucky area where decay fogs the land. walk north-west and you'll meet up with theblack knight titan, standing on an extremely narrow bridge. the titan refuses to budge and won't let you through without a match. the titan can only be killed with theexcaliburequipped, although you may use other weapons to bring down his health. the titan has no specific weakness to an attack style. he doesn't move, so you cansafe spothim or walk away at low health to eat without being damaged. once the titan is at low health, wield the excalibur and finish him off. if you do not use excalibur for the final blow, he'll regenerate all his health and you must fight him again. he can be killed via other sources of damage, includingconjurationwithnecromancy, as long as excalibur is wielded. after you have killed him, cross the bridge and head slightly south-east to thefishermanby the river and talk to him. ask him for a way to get inside the castle, to which he suggests ringing agrail bellby the entrance. make your way south-west to the castle, take the grail bell lying on the ground, near the pile of bricks, and ring it to enter the castle. if the bell does not appear, talk to the fisherman again. if you didn't get the spare whistle while in draynor manor, do so now. there is one on the floor of the castle and one on a table on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]. go directly south and head upstairs and speak to thefisher king. he welcomes you to his realm, saying that the crone and the fisherman were there only to guide you to him. legends say that one day a ""questing knight"" would restore the dark land to its former glory and claim the grail for themself. the king mentions that he is dying and wants to meet his son before he departs. his son,sir percival, is one of arthur's knights of the round table. if you do not ask him about his son, you'll have to do it all over again. head tocamelotand speak toking arthur. though he does not know where percival is, he gives you amagic gold featherwhich points to the golden boots of arkaneeses that percival was seeking. blow on the feather and it will guide you towards thegoblin village. keeping the feather in your inventory, teleport to the falador lodestone and run north to the goblin village. inside the village, head into the east house and open the sacks to find sir percival. he sheepishly admits to getting caught in a goblin trap, after which the goblins bound him in a sack, later forgetting about him. tell him his father wishes to see him; percival doesn't know how to get to the castle, so give him your second magic whistle. return to the fisher king's realm once more by blowing the whistle under the tower north-west of brimhaven. if you have access to thefairy ringsyou may also get there with the codebjr. head back into the castle and go up the staircase and ladder in the eastern-most room, climbing all the way up. pick up the holy grail from the table and head back tocamelot, presenting it toking arthur. congratulations, quest complete!

(if you do not have a penguin suit, you canmake onein a player-owned house.) speak with larry there. he instructs you to find the submarine, find out how to get on the submarine, and to find out how to disable the submarine. allow him to transform you into a penguin. note that, in order to wear the suit, you may not have any main- or off-hand weapons and shields equipped and you are not allowed to wear acape or cloak. head north-west and choose investigate avalanche to enter the penguin lair. note that you must not have a familiar or pet out in order to enter. enter the interrogation room to the west. speak to thekgp interrogator. he tells you to interrogate thecaptured penguin. the captured penguin makes five statements. after he makes all five, you need to respond to each one with a specific piece of dialogue to break his confidence. the captured penguin, now broken, tells you the way to call the submarine: call the captain with the horn of the sea and then do the dance of the sea. the dance consists of three penguin emotes that are different for each player. you must remember these emotes for later. if you forget them, speak with the captured penguin again to be reminded how to call the submarine. search the crate behind you after interrogating the penguin, and you receive aconch shell,puffer,octopus,monkfish, and aray. also note which headgear the captured penguin is wearing in the table below, as you will have to wear the same item as the penguin later in the quest, and the headgear is different for each player. you may fail to steal the items. if that happens, just keep trying. go across the hallway, and talk toping & pongin the music room. you say you need to get into the war room, and they tell you they will write you a lullaby to make the guard sleepy so you can get past him and into the room. talk to thekgp agentby the control panel to the left of the double doors to find out what makes him sleepy and what does not (take notes, you will need it next). go back to ping & pong, and help them finish the lullaby. fill in the words as the two penguin bards ask for them. here's one possible lullaby: for the words in bold, select your own words based on your conversation with the kgp agent. return to the agent, and sing him the lullaby. you see him fall asleep in acutscene. once he's dozing, operate the control panel to open the doors. head east to the war room, and speak with any of thedwarves:baden,glosur,medwin, orobert. you tell him you are a spy, but he wants proof. leave the penguin suit, and speak with the dwarf again. he tells you the dwarves are being forced to create a submarine for the penguins. he says in exchange for penguin suits, he will train you on how to operate the submarine. exit the war room, and you will be kicked out of the base and find yourself next to larry. tell him what you learned. larry will tell you that he cannot cast the shrinking spell on the dwarfs from a distance, but you should still help out the dwarfs by making penguin suits for them. he will tell you that they will need more silk than usual since they are bigger, so you will need 8 pieces of silk total. you will also need 4 regular planks and a thread and needle to make the suits, though he says that the clockwork mechanisms (and therefore the steel bars) will not be necessary. put back on your penguin suit, enter the avalanche, operate the control panel (the kgp agent will still be sleeping) and return to the dwarves in the war room (north east). back in the war room, talk to a dwarf and get out of your penguin suit once again. talk again to a dwarf, give him the supplies, and instruct him in how to construct penguin disguises. in return, the dwarf gives you atoolboxand show you how to use it to disable the submarine. you need to do a practice run on the engine panel near the dwarves and across from the submarine prototype to be allowed to talk to larry again and proceed. inspect the engine panel to start. talk to a dwarf again if you forget how to do something. you can also practice again on the engine panel, if you want. now return to larry and talk with him. he says you need to learn the submarine's location and suggests you findnoodle. put on your penguin suit, and head over to noodle, who is walking around just south of the avalanche. talk to noodle, who gives you akgp id cardand asks you to go into debt with the penguin mafia, which will get you past thetrainee kgp agentand into the eastern (maze-like) filing room. enter the penguin headquarters, and go in the first unlocked door to the east. you must navigate the room without any penguins seeing you. (see the map to the right for your route.) with your compass set to north: search the sorting table to obtain atelegram. next reverse the path you took through the office maze to exit. be sure to take one step out of the door and close the door behind you before you retrace your route, else the path north will be blocked and you will instead move south and be seen. return to larry, and show him the telegram. you cannot take off the penguin suit for a quick exit as you will lose the telegram and have to go through the maze again. logging out will get you to the main hall and the telegram in your inventory removed. larry tells you to meet him on the coast east ofyanille, with all your necessary supplies, including yourclockwork suit,conch shell,toolbox, and thefish hatthat have been worn by captured penguin. do not leave the iceberg area unless you memorised the emote dance routine needed to signal the submarine. this routine was revealed by the captured penguin in the interrogation room and varies for each player. once you have confirmed the captured penguin's headgear and dance routine, make your way toyanille. quick ways to get there include the yanille lodestone home teleport, the watchtower teleport, fairy ring to codecls, or house teleport if your player-owned house is set in yanille. larry is waiting for you just outside the south-east corner of yanille's walls, by the coast. talk tolarry, transform into a penguin, and put on thefish hatthat the captured penguin was wearing. blow theconch shell, and in a short cutscene a periscope emerges out of the water. you now see a menu with thepenguin suit emotes. if you did not write down the sequence of penguin emotes when you interrogated the captive penguin, you must go back to the interrogation chamber and ask the captive for the dance sequence. he will tell you the sequence, and then you can return to the shoreline by yanille. do the three penguin emotes revealed by the captured penguin, and after a cutscene, you find yourself on the western side of the lower level of the submarine, named thered raktuber. the submarine is a long rectangle with two levels. entering the submarine exhausts your run energy, and you can't change the screen angle once you are aboard. if you forgot the three penguin emotes revealed by the captured penguin, you can perform a process of elimination with the penguin emotes. talk with various penguins on the submarine, and they instruct you to report tocaptain marlin. climb up the ladder, open the door (find the door by clicking the wall with the spinning lights), and go east on the top level until you see a door leading to a cabin decorated with a telescope and bookcase. this is the captain's cabin. enter the cabin, andcaptain marlin, acting oddly, says you have returned to destroy him. choosing the honest or lie option makes no difference, as both produce a rambling lecture from the captain about how penguins will never achieve world domination over humans and polar bears and must become one with the sea. eventually, captain marlin comes out from behind the curtain with a slug on his head. after growing tired of you, he sends you to the brig and confiscates yourtoolbox. since the penguins now have their wings on your toolbox, you will need to improvise. in the brig, walk to the western end and search the hatstand to get anelectric eel,shark tooth,crab claw,seaweed, and aswordfishoff of it. these are essentially replacements for thetoolbox. do not attempt to exit through the funnel, as this will put you back on land with larry. open the door to the east with the swordfish (you will receive 100 thieving experience). now, inspect the engine panel. use the crab claw to open the wirebox cover, the shark tooth to cut the wires, the eel to connect the wires, the seaweed to wrap the raw ends, the pufferfish on the pipe as the bellows, the octopus with the control valve wheel (your penguin wings are not fit for pulling the valve), and the swordfish as the lever. the submarine will reroute itself. you see another cutscene, where you end up on adeserted islandsouth-east ofape atoll. it turns out, you were being used by penguin kingpescaling paxto save him the effort of capturing the submarine himself, and the access to the penguin lair was part of the plot. the dwarves were not in fact captured slaves at all but were part of a splinter group from thered axefaction that seek domination over humans—and thank you for providing them withclockwork suits. larry is bundled off to themotherland, and you are left to die a slow death on the deserted island. you cannot access your inventory or spellbook, and are thus unable toteleportoff the island (you can still teleport off of the island using lodestone hotkeys, but it is not recommended to do so).  look for a yellow dot on theminimap, which is a polar bear disguised as a palm tree. talk to the polar bear, namedchuck. after realising that you have seen through his disguise, he informs you that he is apbjagent working withlarryand monitoring you for a breakthrough. he takes you off the island and back to the zoo. you see a cutscene with you floating onchuckwith a pelican flying close by. you then appear outside of the polar bear cage in the zoo. talk tochuckin the cage to receive a warning that you should not attempt to rescuelarryyet and that he himself will be your new contact forpenguin hide and seek. congratulations, quest complete! hunt for red raktuber is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

go past the wall crushers like the other ones, then like before there are pit traps here which you can see and avoid stepping on. after opening the chest, follow the same path back. go to the left (west) door and open it. you need to solve a puzzle. the objective is to flip all of the tiles onto their gold sides. there is no required number of flips that you must make, nor is there any sort of limit. each time you flip a tile, the 8 tiles around it will also flip. different puzzles may be presented, and that one must reset the puzzle many times to get this one. one possible solution to the puzzle is below: first get a puzzle like this. then click on the place where the red highlight is. you get a picture like this. click again on the red highlight. you get a picture like this. click again on the red highlight to complete the puzzle. the puzzle will look like this when solved correctly. once you've solved it, you'll wake up fully healed outside of the pyramid. after you finish the flashback, talk to thesphinx(with yourcat), asking for help, and she will ask you this question: ""a husband and a wife have 6 sons. each son has one sister. how many people are in the family?"" the answer is 9. if you select the incorrect answer, you will lose your cat, and you will have to obtain another one fromgertrude. once answered correctly you will receive asphinx's tokenso you can speak to thehigh priest. go to the high priest, located on the south side of the city (in the temple), and ask him about the remains. he will tell you to put them back in the burial chamber, and that you will need the help of yourcat. before entering the pyramid, take note of what examine text you have when examining your canopic jar. take your weapons and armour for the coming fight. go back to the pyramid and open thecat door. go back through the pyramid until you reach the pit. when you try again to jump the pit, you'll enter another flashback. you'll be starting exactly where you left off with your last flashback. go through the door (no puzzle this time) and attempt to pick up the jar that you had in your inventory before (there are four on the ground). depending on your jar, you will fight a different guardian god: theprotect from magicprayercan make the battles against crondis and apmeken quick and simple. likewise, het and scabaras can be trapped behind the stone table in the room andsafe spotted. you may lootsarcophagishould you wish to do so. once you've defeated it, pick up the samecanopic jar. exit the room to end the flashback, which leaves you next to the pit. you will say to yourself that you think you should put the canopic jar back. go to the west door and return the jar where you found it. once you exit the room, you will automatically retrace your steps and appear at the ladder from the beginning of the pyramid. take this ladder to exit the pyramid. go back to thehigh priest, he will ask if you could help him to prepare for a ceremony by helping the town'scarpenterandembalmer.

speak to one of them on the other side, and they'll complain that protecting themselves from the vampyres has left them tired and hungry, which in turn has made them paranoid – the reason why any outsider is thought to be a vampyre in disguise, come to steal their food and blood. the villagers are also hostile at this point and will throw objects at you, hitting for a small amount of damage. they cannot be convinced to trust you in any way, so you will have to look around. there is a chest just outside the gate – examining it yields the message that it was once stocked with food. put any piece of food in it andflorinwill let you enter, accepting your offering. the easiest way to obtain some food is to kill an acid-spitting snail north-west of mort'ton and cook its meat on a fire made from a nearby tree. ask any villager about ""any 'out of the way' places"", and they will direct you to the basement of the dilapidated pub, just south of the gate. they tell you that the inn basement could be operable if you cleared out the rubble. climb over the small wall in the pub to get to the trapdoor, and then mine the rubble there to clear it. climb down the trapdoor and enter the basement. the entire room is filled with piles of rubble; you must mine each heap and dig up the remains to fill yourbuckets. if you forgot a bucket, there is one by the water pump at the town entrance. you can hop worlds to obtain more buckets without having to wait for it to respawn. there are 15 piles of rubble to remove in total and you may find that you need to make several trips. do not clear more piles of rubble than you can remove with a bucket, because if you leave the room you'll have to re-mine the rubble piles that you did not clear out into a bucket. the buckets can only be emptied on the pile of rubble upstairs, next to the pub, or anywhere outside the town. you can also drop the fully filled buckets on the ground in the basement if you have more empty buckets. one bucket holds three piles of rubble, although you may also findbroken glass,rocks, and 20-40nails(bronze to mithril), as well as aplaster fragmentand adusty scrollwith a letter in it. the fragment depicts morytania and the seven warriors, one holding asilvthril rodand theguthix balance potionthat was used to fight some dark creatures; the letter on the scroll is written bysialathinand addressed tolantania, both inhabitants ofhallowvale, about preparing an escape. once all piles are cleared, your attention will be directed to aplaqueon the north wall. read it – it mentionsqueen efaritayand her hallowed children. keep the nails, since you'll need them later, and discard the rest. after clearing the basement, go and talk to a villager again. they will accept your help to patch up the town, and will mention that you can start with the town's general store. if you've permanently curedrazmire, you may wish to note your snails/mackerel to sell and re-buy from his store, preventing an extra trip to a bank. you can also bring a weapon to kill snails, orfishfor the mackerel required (although it says ""mackerel"", both raw and cooked would work). speak withaurelin the general store to the east. he tells you that you need to repair the roof and the broken wall of the shop. investigating the holes leads you to the conclusion that the structures were once held together by planks and nails, so you will require the same items to repair them. if you have completedshades of mort'ton, you can go tomort'tonshop and buy a fewplanks. you'll need six normal planks to repair the shop, as well as somenails. climb the ladder outside the store, and repair the roof by using a plank on the damaged part; repeat on the damaged wall next to the store door. when you've repaired the shop, talk toaurelagain – he wants the store stocked before he can open it. he gives you acratein which to put the resources he requires; all items must be un-noted to be put in the crate, however you do not need to have all the items in your inventory at once to fill the crate. aurel requires: the snails can be found near the north-western entrance to mort'ton and there are big net fishing spots south of the burgh de rott bank. if you didn't bring these with you, you'll have to go to a bank now – the mort'ton general store sells tinderboxes if you need any. go back to aurel and return the stocked crate. the town general store is now up for business. he suggests you help fix the bank, since it's been broken for a long time. any item used on the bank booth before you repair it will be sent to your bank. be careful not to use the wrong item. talk tocorneliusnear the bank to the south. he asks you to repair the bank booth first, and then to look at the walls. searching the booth yields a lot of broken glass and the remains of wooden structures held together by nails. you need 2 planks and a piece ofswamp paste, as well as 8 nails – you can buy the planks and paste atrazmire builders' merchantsafter completing shades of mort'ton, and you may use the nails dug up from the heaps of rubble. first, repair the teller window, and then repair the back wall by using three planks and 12 nails. speak to cornelius again, who tells you that the bank now only requires a manager; ask him if he would fancy the job, which he gladly accepts. from this point, the bank is available even if you don't complete the quest. talk to anyone in the village (other than cornelius) and they'll request you to check the broken furnace in the south-east part of the town. examining the furnace leads you to the conclusion that it is made of steel, so take 2steel barsand 1coaland head to the furnace. repair the furnace and fuel it with the coal before lighting it with your last tinderbox (tool belt will not work).  acutscenethen plays, showing a man namedgadderanksand two bodyguards conversing withvanstrom klauseabout blood tithes and how they are becoming insufficient for the vampyres. gadderanks is unable to meet the blood tithe quota required of him;canifisis already paying more than they originally agreed to, and mort'ton is just full of the afflicted. at that point, vanstrom smells the smoke from the furnace you just lit. the vampyres have discovered the location of burgh de rott – the last free settlement in morytania! he tells gadderanks that a new source of blood tithes has shown up, and threatens him to be quick about it. after the cutscene, you will need to prepare for a fight with thesilver sickle (b)or anothersilver weapon.do notuse a guthix balance potion on the vampyre juvinates during this fight. it will not credit your kills, and you will be forced to leave the general store and complete the fight again to progress the quest.silver boltsfired from a crossbow will not affect the vampyre juvinates. go to the general store and speak with gadderanks who has set up shop in the store, and is about to havewiskittithed. speak withgadderanks, wiskit, and one of the juvinates, and gadderanks will try to kill you for interfering. you would then enter a combat encounter, which you can leave through the south door of the store. gadderanks and the juvinates become attackable, but not aggressive. gadderanks is level 58 and attacks by whacking you with his warhammer; he always spawns at a fixed spot on the west side of the store and he cannot move, so you can use any weapon with a 2+attack rangeto kill him without ever being hit. gadderanks is weak to fire spells. the male juvinate is level 58 and the female juvinate is level 63. veliaf will appear to help you in the middle of battle, usually after you defeat the first opponent and has attacked the second. if you do not have any silver weapon to produce for this battle, you cannot deal any damage to the juvinates, but veliaf can extinguish both vampyre juvinates on his own, although it would take some time. prayer (e.g.protect from ranged) and food may be necessary either way, especially for low-level players, as the silver weapons you can use at this point are very weak. after gaining victory over them, you find thatgadderanksstill has some breath in him; talk to him. he will tell you of the vampyres' weaknesses, referring to theguthix balance potionthat you read about in the fragment, and asks you to find his family, the reason why he had been supporting the vampyres, then finally dies. you will gethis hammerfrom aurel, which has the same stats as aniron 2h swordbut stronger againstshades. talk to veliaf and he will tell you to meet him back at the hideout in the hollows. use the canifis bank or the now-accessible burgh de rott bank to stock up for the upcoming fights if you are not prepared already. followers such as summoning familiars and pets are not allowed during this portion of the quest. go back to the hideout below the canifis pub and talk to veliaf. he will have you talk toradigadandpolmafito have them head to the burgh de rott hideout, but wants you to escortivan stromto thepaterdomustemple because the mission is becoming too dangerous for the young, aspiring priest. bring armour and a silver weapon; players may also choose to bring aguthix balance potionfor the fight against the juvinates.silver boltsdowork here. lower-levelled players may also take some armour, food, and weapon for ivan, but remember that you will not get any of them back. talk to polmafi fedigris and radigad ponfit first, and after that ""use"" asteel chainbody,steel platelegs,steel med helmand asilver sickleon ivan, who will accept your gifts and wear it under his robes. you may also provide food to him before you start; ivan only likes ""cooked snails,salmon,cooked slimy eelorstew"" and he can carry up to 15 food items. once the trip is underway, you cannot give ivan any additional food or armour. speak to ivan, who has already been briefed by veliaf and is ready to go. you must now choose between two routes – a long and short one – through the mort myre swamp. on the short route, there are 2 level 68vampyre juvinates, while on the long route you find 2 level 60 ones. they are not aggressive, but must be defeated to proceed. if your combat level is too low or you do not feel like killing the juvinates, a guthix balance potion will work for the juvinates – but just during the quest. the juvinates' health doesn't have to reach 0; it just needs to be low enough for them to disappear to regenerate. once you escort ivan to safety, you will part ways in front of the entrance to thetemple. enter through the mausoleum entrance into the temple and talk todrezel. you need to talk about veliaf's insights on ivandis and his enchanted rod, but you will make him upset by asking for proof of the burial. he, as a devout follower ofsaradomin, is convinced that ivandis seergaze was buried with his six companions and believes veliaf to be erring on the matter. work on his sympathy, mentioning the risk to those poor souls left in morytania to allow you to investigate. when you are successful, you will get thetemple library keyfrom him. the secret library is under the same room as drezel. there is a keyhole in the east wall, which will open a trapdoor in the floor. go down into the library and search the bookshelves to get three books –the sleeping seven,histories of the hallowland, andmodern day morytania. study them all carefully. the sleeping sevenspeaks about the location of ivandis' tomb, and his possessions. the book reveals that, according to rumour, ivandis was buried in a small cavern accessed via the north-eastern wall of a tunnel beneath mort myre, marked by fake beast marks.modern day morytaniadescribes morytania geographically, mentioning canifis, the castle of the northern lords,port phasmatys,mort myre swamp, the mort ridge mines, mort'ton, thehaunted woods, burgh de rott, evenmeiyerditch,darkmeyer, thebarrowsand finallycastle drakan.histories of the hallowlanddescribes the history ofhallowvale, the former name for morytania, and speaks of ivandis' weapon, which has a very precise size and is made ofsilvthriland asapphire, before being blessed by saradomin. go to the cellar through the trapdoor south of the bar in canifis, and go through the secret wall. near the wall, on the east side wall of the long cavern, there should be some boarded up area. break the boards to reveal a secret entrance. go in the cave to find ivandis' final resting place. examine ivandis' coffin; an imprint of ivandis' rod can be found on top of it and you conclude that the weapon was made of a silver and mithril alloy and that it gives off both mortal and divine energies. optionally, return to veliaf and tell him about the tomb and how the rod is fused to the coffin; he will desperately let out that it might not be your destiny to obtain the rod, but drops a hint that you may be able to create a mould from the fused rod. use a piece soft clay on the top of the tomb to get arod clay mould. once you've made the mould, go to a furnace (the only ones in morytania are in burgh de rott and port phasmatys) and click the silver bar in the casting metals to make asilvthril rod, as described by the various clues you have found. looking at it reveals that it lacks the mortal and divine energies you sensed, although its dimensions are correct. enchant it using thelvl-1 enchantspell. the divine energies are still lacking, but the mortal enchantment is now present. take the enchanted silvthril rod and a rope back topaterdomus. enter the mausoleum and use the rod on the well at the centre, with the rope in your inventory, to create a fully chargedrod of ivandis. take the rod of ivandis to the cellar of theburgh de rottpub, and give it to veliaf. congratulations, quest complete! in aid of the myreque is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

vanstrom doesn't have the time to bring the weapons to his friends he has never actually met yet. if you agree to help vanstrom, he will also tell you about a boatman inmort'tonwho is rumoured to be able to show you the myreque hideout. on the route tomort'ton, etherealghastswill attack you, siphoning any food from you and rotting it in the process; if you have a charged druid pouch, an item will be subtracted from the pouch instead. make sure to have plenty because five items are needed in your pouch when you reach your destination. for more information on refilling the pouches, clickhere. alternatively, take sixmort myre fungusso that you can fill the pouch twice once you arrive in mort'ton. enter the gate south-west of canifis, nearulizius, and keep going south, following theriver salveuntil thenature grottolooms up east of you. exit the swamp south and go along the twirling path to arrive in the plagued village of mort'ton. head east until you findcyreg paddlehornat his boat, and talk to him. attempt to persuade cyreg to bring you to the myreque. cyreg will be very secretive about how to find them though, so you will have to choose the correct sequence of responses to make him feel guilty in order for him to allow you to use his boat. choose the following responses in this order: if you haven't filled your druid pouch yet, you should fill it now. talk to him again afterwards, and he will agree to take you, but he needs 3 woodenplanks. they are sold inrazmire builders' merchants, mort'ton'sgeneral store, but you must have (partially) completedshades of mort'tonand curedrazmire keelganwithserum 208to use it. when you give cyreg the planks, he will give you directions and you can now finally board the boat, though he won't let you travel unless you are carrying yourdruid pouchwith at least five charges and 75steel nails. once you land atthe hollows, go directly north, avoiding the ghasts, until you see a strange tree. the bridge is visible on the minimap. climb up to see a damaged rope bridge. mend the bridge as you walk along, which requires 1plankand 25steel nailsper platform (total of 3 planks and 75 steel nails), and then climb down the other side of the bridge. go north to the strange-looking hollow tree and talk tocurpile fyodout front. tell him you've brought the weapons for the myreque and then answer some questions for him to prove that you are indeed telling the truth. if you fail to answer the questions correctly you will be knocked unconscious and wake up at the boat again, but luckily the bridge will require no building the second time. here are the answers to the possible questions: head behind the huge tree and open the doors, which curpile will unlock once you answer the questions. go in and follow the tunnel. follow the wall until you see stalagmites on the east side, and click the ""squeeze-past stalagmite"" option to find a cave filled with myreque members. start off by talking toveliaf hurtz, who will tell you to talk to all of the others, and then come back to him. it shouldn't be necessary to actually ask any questions of them, just saying ""ok, thanks"" and going to the next one works. they will speak about themselves, and the myreque. you can talk to veliaf to get a checklist of who you still need to talk to. when finished, give the weapons toveliaf. a cutscene ensues where a strangemistenvelopes the room and veliaf realises that it is avampyre. the mist shifts, revealing vanstrom klause, the stranger you were trying to help. he killssani piliuandharold evanswith a magic attack and transforms into his vampyre form. after performing the murders, vanstrom disappears, before summoning a level 44skeleton hellhound(""his little pet"") to finish off the remaining members. in order to regain the myreque's trust after having lured vanstrom to them, you must kill the hellhound. the hellhound has low life points, but hits fairly hard; the fight should be fairly easy for players with a combat level above 80. on death, the hellhound will drop twouncut rubiesand fourbig bones. talk to veliaf and ask him how to leave the hideout, and he tells you about a secret passage tocanifis. leave the chamber, and search the wall at the end of the tunnel to open it; you can now use this door freely. climb up the ladder to emerge behind thehair of the dogtavern. do not teleport to canifis or leave the hideout by any other method, because the dialogue with the stranger will not allow you to end the quest. go into the tavern once more and talk to thestrangerwhere vanstrom klause used to be. you mistake him for vanstrom, but he claims to be an everyday random man. confused, complete the conversation anyway and you'll finish the quest. in search of the myreque is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

twisting tunnel. make your way to the end of the tunnel; anagilityshortcut is available. climb over the rocks, and then talk to one of the villagers guarding a dark entrance. the villagers will eerily explain that they are again working and want the fruit of their labour to be a surprise for outsiders. make your way back to kennith. as you climb back over the rocks, you will nearly be hit by falling rocks. once back with kennith, you will find him acting strangely, having lost all interest in the shrine and sea slugs; instead, he wants to find his parents. make your way tokennith's parents,kentandcaroline, located outside the east side of the church, and speak with them. your conversation with the parents is odd. kent will then stop talking, slip you anote, and run off. read the note, which asks you to meet kent at the entrance of thelegends' guildbecause he finds it difficult to talk openly inwitchaven. walk to the legends' guild north of witchaven, and talk to kent. he will explain that kennith is a demanding son and is worried that kennith may be seeking revenge onkimberly, a new girl in town, for losing his favourite toy train. he will ask you to check on kimberly to make sure she is safe. if you log out during this section, the villagers will reset and kimberly will return to her house. you will have to start the process over from the first set of villagers. return to witchaven, and talk to kimberly, who is in the northernmost house in witchaven, nearjeb. she will explain that villagers have been surrounding her house chanting her name and that she has been hearing banging and digging noises below her house. agree to accompany her around town to look for her parents, who have gone missing. a cutscene will occur in which the villagers surround her house, demanding that she come out to play. kimberly will ask you to act as bait to lead the villagers to the church and then lock them in. she believes that the power of saradomin will calm them down, which appears to be true, as the villagers eventually sit peacefully in the pews after they're locked up. run around the house to get the four villagers following you, and then head to the church. they won't attack you but easily get stuck behind obstacles. get them all in the church, then run out and close the door. now talk to kimberly and follow her tokennith's house. follow kimberly to kennith, directly west of the church. talk to kimberly, where she will then begin talking to kennith about the disappearance of her parents and ask if kennith has seen them. kennith will deny having seen them, and mention that his own parents are ""indisposed"" at the moment. he will deny that he is worried about his missing parents. kimberly will then ask if you hear something outside. a cutscene will play showing that the villagers have escaped, and she will ask you once again to get rid of the villagers. lead them back to the church, closing the door again to keep them inside. talk to kimberly and follow her toezekial lovecraft, at the fishing store. again, talk to kimberly to start the dialogue with ezekial, who will reveal that the new caverns in the shrine lead under kimberly's house. ezekial offers to allow you into the guarded area in the shrine, as he is recognised as one of the villagers. talk with kimberly. then head to the old ruin entrance and, as before, make your way back to the guarded shrine entrance. ezekial will be waiting for you there. talk to ezekial and then to one of the two villagers, and you will be let in. this intermediate room has two doors: the metal one is locked. talk to ezekial once more. he will ask you to travel through the cavern behind the wooden door to unlock the metal door. if you log out during your trip through all of the rooms, don't worry: you will be able to just run right through them without having to sneak around so long as you have stunned the villagers by putting rubium in the vents. go through the wooden door. you will be in a large room, which looks like a minigame. your goal is to prospect the far wall and break through it, without being seen. if you get caught, the villagers will ""roughly drag you to the entrance and throw you out of the room,"" so be careful. your first move once inside can either be to hide behind one of the minecarts or to run and hide behind the wall in the south. if you plan to go the whole way, you will need to set off just as the last miner has turned to face in the other direction; otherwise, you will be spotted and thrown out. if you only get to one of the minecarts in the first stage, make sure that none of the miners is looking at you, and then dash behind the southern wall, watching that you don't position yourself directly on the eastern end since you can be seen from that position. once you are hidden behind the southern wall, make your way into one of the three alcoves opposite of the wall you will prospect to the east. before moving to the wall to prospect, make sure all the miners are facing in the direction of the carts and you are standing as far away from them as possible by the eastern wall. the wall in which you should prospect is the on the north side of the east wall, across from the middle alcove. do this when the two miners who could potentially see you are facing away. after prospecting, quickly making your way back to the hiding space. wait until they have come back to stand in front of you and head away again, then mine the rock that has been prospected and quickly enter the gap. you will find yourself in a narrow tunnel with mine tracks. follow the tunnel until you get to a lever on one side of the tunnel and a metal door on the other. use the lever, and ezekial will come through the door and follow you. head back around the tunnel until you reach the entrance of the tunnel you came through, go through the door on the eastern wall south of the entrance. you will find kent and caroline in here. talk with them, and they will blabber about kennith and how the slugs are doing great work. you see they will be of little use helping you with your task. speak again to ezekial. he will tell you aboutrubiumand give his suggestions on how to traverse the second room. walk through the wooden door. this time you are in a room with four minecarts, with the villagers carrying material between the carts and the centre pillar. your task is to mine fourrubiumand put it in the steam vents. make sure to have run mode on. the steam vents are one-click, so you don't need to first click the rubium in your inventory to put it in a vent. the rubium may also combust, sending you out of the room. if that happens, just reenter the room. there are likely many successful methods, but here is one (each instruction must be done when the villagers are all close to the centre pillar): proceed to the south-east door. if your control panel is covering up the door, just close the open control panel to see and then open the south-east door. an active sign of the porter will bank your rubium. make sure to unequip one if you have it or you will be unable to complete this section until it depletes. talk to ezekial in the next room to get advice about the third room. you may need to switch your video tools section to high definition to access the rubium in the north-east, as otherwise the minimap will obscure this area. enter the wooden door to end up in anotherrubium-filled room. again, there may be many successful methods, but here is one (of course, making sure that the villagers aren't facing you when you move into view). with run turned on: proceed through the east door to a room withkimberly's parents (katherineandclive) and ezekial, and talk to them. they tell you to find kennith. exit through the door, and retrace your steps back through the rooms, past the villagers and kennith's parents, until you return to the tunnel with the mine tracks. follow the tracks back to the metal door opposite the lever you used earlier. pass through the door. talk to kennith, who is in the room. a short cutscene will occur, in which kennith reveals that he enslaved the villagers, kidnapped kimberly's parents, and tried to crush you with rocks all as a scheme to get revenge on kimberly for losing his toy train. kimberly will be floating in an ""energy bubble"" with kennith hovering near her, shooting off sparks. talk to kimberly, who will give you the location of thetoy train. make your way back to town to the train's location. this location varies from player to player. find the train in the area that kimberly specified, and pick it up. it will be lying on the ground, but no red dot will appear on the minimap, so look carefully. if you can't see it, try turning off textures and ground decoration in your graphic settings, as this will make it stand out more. return to the room with kennith and kimberly, and use the train on the boy, calming his demonic rage and freeing kimberly. you will see one final cutscene. the seemingly normal kent thanks you for your ""heroic"" act, as does ezekial. quest complete! toy with this! what was that? if you talk to the parents of kimberly, they are at the end of the cave (where you found them mining in the quest), they will ask you to fetch an item from the surface. the items that may be requested are listed below: the player will receive 2coal stone spiritsin exchange for the item. the requested item cannot be noted. by equipping leather boots and an iron hatchet, the player may bring 2 spades, hammers, tinderboxes and leather boots,

a short cutscene occurs where you are captured by the dragonkin. after the cutscene, you will find yourself in a cell beside sliske's cell. talk to him, and he will explain thedragonkinare becoming more dangerous. after talking with him, interact with thedragonkin guardoutside; it will ignore you. talk to sliske again (any option works); after talking to him, interact with the guard. you will attempt to grab the keys while the guard is giving youfood, but fail. use the food on thelatrine(toilet). you will notice that it reacts with whatever is down there, and you need to get it out. use the emptyplateon aloose brickin your cell, and you will obtain twoplate halvesand abrick. use the brick on one of the halves to get ablade, then use the blade on thebarracks bedto get acloth strip. then use the cloth on the brick to create aludicrous flail, and give it to sliske. sliske will grab thepotionon the nearby shelf, resulting in the guard going into sliske's cell and beating him up. pickpocket the guard while he is beating up sliske. talk to sliske to get a cloth strip, then use either the potion orbag of crystalson the latrine. use the cloth on theempty bottle, then usebottle on a stringon the latrine to retrieve thebottle of acid. talk to sliske, who will distract the guard, then use the acid on thecell door. open sliske's door. he will then reveal that this was simply a ruse, telling you that the dragonkin guard is just a wight in an elaborate disguise. after sliske reveals his ruse, leave the prison. sliske tells you that he is playing a game and will award you with thestaff of armadylif you win. he then killsbrother samwellto threaten the player into participating before you are taken to the first room. enter the fighting pit and you will have two options: either to torturedharok the wretchedor help him. if torturing him, simply release the gates imprisoning the saradominist champion, which you take control of. the champion has different attack styles you can use against dharok. eventually, dharok would be killed by the champion. alternatively, if helping dharok, speak to him in the pit. dharok tells you that he wants to get out of the pit, because he wants to stop fighting. to get through, tell dharok to stop fighting and allow thesaradomin crusadersto kill him, by telling him that he is already dead. once this is done, dharok will die to the crusaders. regardless of choice taken, he realises his actions and now freed, asks you to save his brother ahrim. ahrim the blightedis trapped in a maze, with the player controlling him. to help ahrim, he must be led to the centre of the maze for a ""reward"" by sliske. while traversing the maze, there will be six blue grates in the ground. when ahrim steps on one, sliske tells you that ahrim must move in one of the two directions; one of them will blast ahrim with blue flames, while the other will blast meg, linza or rancour instead. it does not matter which way ahrim goes, but at the end of the maze, if you successfully persuaded him to bear the flames at least four times, it will determine ahrim's moral outcome. you can click through walls to get ahrim to walk automatically along the maze to that point. if you leave the area by any means, it will be completely reset when returning. once ahrim reaches the centre, he will putisoldeandguthan the infestedinside. after bringing you into the room as a witness, another moral decision occurs: you can either allow the two brothers to argue or try to break the conversation up. at the end of the conversation, if four or more of the decisions in the maze resulted in ahrim being blasted by blue flames, ahrim will ask isolde for forgiveness; otherwise, ahrim will kill her. regardless of your choice, ahrim's games are finished and you will need to help verac. enter theimpressive doorwayto your north. upon entering, you will seeverac the defiledbeing ""pulled"" apart bysaradomin statueandzamorak statuerespectively. you are tasked with breaking verac from his chains and freeing him. verac will request for you to release the zamorak statue by having linza, meg or rancour use thekey makerto create thezamorak key. the zamorak key will always break when used on the zamorak statue. instead, rip thesaradomin keyout of verac and use it on the saradomin statue, collapsing it and revealing a second room. speak to verac, and you will automatically enter the room, sliske's laboratory. grab the four books lying around the laboratory:sliske's ramblingson the table in the north-west corner of the main room,a visit to an old friendon the table in the south-west corner in the same room,death at seaon the table in the south-east corner in the same room, andthe divine delusionon the table on the east side of the east room. pick them up individually and do not use thearea loot interfaceto pick up both books at the same moment. not picking them up individually may cause the game to no track the clue progress correctly. if this does occur, return to the lobby and re-enter the trapdoor. then, pick up the books again. inspect theorrery,the globe hanging from the ceiling but not theglobeon another side, to start a cutscene. once all five of sliske's secrets are unlocked, interact with theshadow focus. after the shadow focus is interacted with, you will see linza, rancour and meg with the remaining three brothers. guthan is inside a large metal ball balanced on top of a two-way slide, and sliske tells them that guthan is the ""balance""; if he falls one way, he will killtorag the corruptedandkaril the tainted, while if he falls other way, he will kill a former saradominist commander,commander jaycliff, that guthan unintentionally killed in a drunken stupor. go through all dialogue options with guthan, or interact with the lever in front of guthan, until you get the notification for meg to impersonate the player (any style works). after her panicked impersonation, sliske will become angry and enter the room. after the player arrives and sliske sees through your lies, he attempts to drain the player's soul with the staff of armadyl. he'll discover that you know his secrets, and a short cutscene occurs where he brutally pummels the player, up close and personal. after the cutscene ends, sliske will explain that linza and relomia worked together for this plot, much to the player, meg and rancour's shock. sliske further explains that linza had stolen the knowledge of dragon smithing and their ore, so linza went to sliske to bargain a deal for protection. sliske then betrays linza, and turns her into one of hiswights. sliske siphoning your soul with the staff of armadyl sliske beats you sliske turns linza into a wight after linza's deception, sliske attempts to have you and the others killed, but the barrows brothers refuse to help him, giving you time to escape. the player must escape with rancour and meg from the tunnels; there are 120 seconds to escape while rocks fall on their head. if the timer runs out, you'll start at the beginning, without restoring your health. if you die, it is an unsafe death and you will respawn in death's office; players will want to bring food here, as damage can be anywhere up to 4000. it is highly advised to havefreedomandanticipateon the ability bar, as rocks can stun the player for up to 10 seconds in addition to dealing quite some damage. should you die in the tunnels, simply return to the trapdoor entrance in daemonheim. in several areas of the tunnels, there will be small groups of aggressive wights that will spawn when you near the location; they can be easily ignored as their combat level is too low to actually deal significant damage. there are three ropes leading out of the cave. two of the ropes are unstable and will cause rocks to fall and stun you. the third rope will lead you out of the cave. the position of the stable rope is different for each player; using the mini-map, click on the ladder icons to run to each one and attempt to escape. there is a ""check rope"" option; the correct rope will be described as ""sturdy"". once the player escapes with meg and rancour, they will return to their normal duties. speak with dharok, who is on top of karil's mound. (make sure your inventory has 4 empty spaces; if it is full, the reward lamps can be reclaimed by speaking tomajor mary rancourin burthorpe.) dharok tells the player that whatever they did, they have some slight freedom from sliske's control. he also tells you that sliske's control over linza is slightly weaker, most likely due to the recent events, and that she can still be saved. he tells you that the brothers will pretend that sliske has complete control over them and will help the player out at the right time, and returns to his crypt. congratulations, quest complete! kindred spirits is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: quest banner unused concept art of the barrows brothers' childhood farm concept art for sliske's lair concept art for scenery in sliske's lair concept art for scenery in sliske's lair concept art for the arena during dharok's trial the prison in which you meet sliske"

jaakwill show you around thelava-flow mineand explain a little bit, until he spots an odd person who is not supposed to be there. thiscloaked figurewill then turn around, revealing himself as a chaos dwarf, and commit suicide, after which the boilers of the mine are seriously damaged and the ceiling collapses. speak to jaak, who is standing near the entrance, who will tell you to rescue thelava-flow minerswho have been hit by rocks. one free inventory space is required to pick up theminers, and each must be handed over to jaak before rescuing another one. if you log out during this part you will have to rescue the miners again. in order to save the miners, you will need to mine the smaller, lighter-coloured piles of rubble to reach them. if a piece of rubble can't be mined, a message will appear saying so and you will have to try another. upon reaching a miner, free the dwarf from the rubble and take them back to foreman jaak. after two of the dwarves have been freed, a black guard squad will appear on the scene, but they will place the state of the damaged equipment at a higher priority than the injured miners at the order of theconsortium. rescue the remaining four miners from the rubble and exit the mine. two miners will have died, and two will be unconscious. talk to jaak after rescuing them all, who will thank you and send you outside. outside the mine there will be a crowd of protesters led byveldabandemonstrating against the consortium. after talking to veldaban about what transpired inside the mine, ablack guard soldierwill arrive and arrest veldaban as the consortium suspects that he was involved with the explosion. the guard will take him to the top floor of the palace. head to the top floor of the palace in the middle of keldagrim and talk to the directors to convince them that veldaban was not involved with the incident. first, speak toveldabanand ask him why he is so angry. tell him to calm down, or the directors will not release him. talk to theblue opal director,and select ""tell me about the lava flow mine."" respond with, ""so the chaos dwarf blew up the secondary boilers?"" talk to thegreen gemstone director,and select ""i was there when the explosion happened."" then tell him, ""i rescued some of the miners."" tell thebrown engine director,""what did you want to do about the miners?"" answer with, ""it was a difficult decision. i understand."" talk to theyellow fortune director,and select ""why did you arrest veldaban?"" then tell her, ""veldaban's popular. arresting him makes you look worse."" once you have finished talking to all of the directors and veldaban, talk to theconsortium general secretary. tell him that you've talked to everyone that you need to talk to, and a cut scene will commence. if you have a familiar or pet out, you must dismiss it as you cannot proceed with the vote otherwise. the directors will agree to free veldaban into your care, but just as they do, another black guard will interrupt the meeting. he will tell you that protesters are gathering outside of the palace walls demanding a king be put into power, and also thatcolonel grendaand her first division have been sent to the caves ofbarendirto ward off an army ofchaos dwarves. now that veldaban has been released into your care, he will follow you around the city. if you should somehow lose him, he will be waiting for you at thelaughing minerpub located in east keldagrim. take veldaban with you to the crowd of protesters gathered on the east side of the palace, and talk tohreidmar, who is leading the protest. hreidmar will have the crowd eating out of his hand with all of the protesters energetically agreeing to everything he says. veldaban will suggest that you findmeike, the leader ofmonarchist society. talk to one of the protesters and ask them where meike is, and they will respond saying that they don't know, but she's usually at theking's axe inn, just south of the bank in keldagrim west. head to the pub in keldagrim west and talk toluitger, who is sitting in the pub by himself. he will say that he too doesn't know where meike is either. ask him why he didn't join the protest, and he will tell you that he got cold feet when the revolution actually started, especially since he heard that a protester was arrested. veldaban will suggest that you check in the black guard headquarters to see if meike was the one who was arrested. go to the black guard hq, which is located north of the pub and west of the bank. however,klaaswas the dwarf that was arrested, not meike. talk to klaas and ask him where meike is, but he will refuse to reveal her location. veldaban will step in and intimidate and threaten the dwarf into telling you where she's hiding. he will tell you that she's at the top of the tower where you killedhildainforgiveness of a chaos dwarf, which is just south of the western palace and south-east of thestonemason. meike will be standing alone at the top of the tower. talk to her and ask her why she's not participating in the protests. she will reveal that she doesn't know what to do, because if the revolt succeeds, hreidmar will become the new king as he claims to be the descendant ofking alvis. suggest that you go to the records chamber first to find out if he truly is the successor, and meike will offer to help. she will tell you that you need the keys to the chamber, which she might be able to make duplicates of from the library. meike and veldaban will then leave, telling you that they'll meet you when you're ready in the library, which is located north-east of the bank, near the river. if you do not already have 6 pieces of soft clay and 6 mithril bars with you, go and get them and meet them in the library (which is just west of the bridge connecting the two parts of the city). once you have the necessary supplies, proceed to the library and talk to meike and veldaban. meike will tell you to talk to thelibrarianabout unlocking the display case. she will say that he will most likely give you the key since she is there to supervise you and they are familiar with each other. ask the librarian to open the case, and he will give you akeldagrim library keyto the case. unlock the cabinet and try to take the keys back, but the librarian will stop you. neither will he allow you to use soft clay on the keys. meike will suggest that you give her the clay so she can make the moulds while you distract the librarian. use the soft clay on her and then talk to the librarian. ask the librarian about the keys, and he will explain how the keys are one of the most ancient and treasured artefacts of the library, dating back to the age of the kings. when you are finished talking to the librarian, return to meike, who will have successfully made clay moulds of the six keys. she will give you the six moulds telling you to make mithril copies in a furnace. the furnace in keldagrim palace in the north-east corner is the closest.superheat itemwill not work. use a key mould on the furnace and make the six keys. once you have made copies of the keys, meet meike and veldaban in the records chamber, the entrance to which is west of the black guard hq. go through the entrance, located west of the black guard headquarters, and speak to meike or veldaban. meike will tell you that the symbols on the keyholes have worn away over time, so you will have to figure out which key goes where by yourself. there are 6 keyholes to match the 6 keys that you have, with three keyholes on either side of the door. it is a process of trial and error. if you cannot figure it out, the correct combination to unlock the door is (from southern-most keyhole to northern-most keyhole): 5, 1, 4, 6, 3, 2. after all of the keys are in the correct keyhole, open the door. as the door opens and reveals the records chamber, meike will exclaim that she never thought she'd live to see the chamber. during a short cutscene, it will be revealed that hreidmar truly is the heir to the throne. should the consortium yield to the protesters and reinstate a king in charge of keldagrim, hreidmar and his chaos dwarf army would take over keldagrim. meike will offer to alter the records to make it look like hreidmar is not the rightful heir, but veldaban will refuse to let her, as he does not want to be king. after a short talk with meike he will agree and meike will then suggest that you first find a way to deal with the chaos dwarf army while she looks for a rule to potentially disqualify hreidmar from the throne. when you are ready and stocked up, talk to veldaban and ask him to lead you to thebarendircaves. if you have a familiar out veldaban will say you already have a follower, and you will have to meet him in the laughing miner pub in east keldagrim. when there, enter the tunnel and talk tocolonel grenda, who will describe the huge army. you must now proceed through the tunnel (at some point, there will be a side-tunnel to the east, ignore it for now). at the end of the tunnel, you will encountercolonel grimssonand some lackeys. talk to him. when you first meet him, veldaban will try to make peace with him, but he will mock him with the loss of his girlfriend, hilda, and from his dialogue veldaban realises that grimsson himself had been brainwashed bythe red axe, with which he will start to tease him. this will make grimsson very angry and he will attack the level 84 veldaban, who attacks with anadamant warhammer. should veldaban die, you will reappear outside barendir and can immediately re-enter to reattempt the fight. this can be done as many times as you need. if you have a multicannon set up when veldaban dies, it will be lost and you will have to reclaim it from the dwarven engineer. if you feel that you are not adequately prepared for the boss fight, head to a bank to stock up on supplies. should you need to leave keldagrim, veldaban will leave, telling you that he will be waiting for you at the laughing miner pub (which is the pub east in the city) when you return. veldaban will be able to do a bit of damage to colonel grimsson (hits range from 0 to 60), but you must ensure that he does not die. when the colonel is attacked by the player, he will start attacking you using ranged and melee attacks. his attacks do not have very good accuracy, but when they do occasionally hit, they will usually deal around 150-200 damage. the colonel is weak to stab attacks and can be poisoned, so players may wish to make use of that. he should not be a problem for most players, as he has a very low maximum hit and even then hits somewhat rarely. after he has been defeated, he will retreat. try to enter the tunnel through which he fled to see the colossal army, then talk to veldaban on what to do next. if veldaban disappears when teleporting the player to the caves, the only way to have veldaban return is to log out and then log back in. speak to veldaban and suggest that you get reinforcements. if you choose to pursue the colonel, your character will be intimidated by the size of the chaos dwarf army. tell veldaban that perhaps the trolls should become involved in the fight. after a short discussion, you will go to the trolls for help without veldaban. head back halfway through the caves until you come to an entrance on the east side. go through the entrance to find yourself in a smalltrollsettlement and speak topretty flowerin the middle, but he will ignore you saying that you are not worthy enough to talk to him. ask him how you can prove your worth, and he will tell you that you must be strong enough to lift big rock. there is abig rockin the room, near the wall. lift it. if you have 90strengthor more, you will carry the rock away and keep it in your inventory (can be done any time after the quest as well). after you lift the rock, pretty flower will tell you that he wanted you to lift the troll namedbig rock. pick the troll up, who is walking around the rock, and big rock will exclaim that he didn't think any human could possibly pick him up but that you were strong enough to do so. pretty flower will now agree to talk to you. you may now approach him about the problem with the chaos dwarves, although he will still refuse to take part in the fight no matter what option you pick. talk to my arm who is standing in a corner and ask him how you can get pretty flower to listen to you. after a slightly confusing conversation with my arm concerning pretty flower andpretty flowers, ask him which pretty flower he's talking about. he will reveal that he was referring to a flower that he had, pretty flower. ask him if you can have the pretty flower so that you can give it to pretty flower. he will agree and hand over the flower to you. take the pretty flower that my arm gave you to pretty flower and show it to him. tell him that it's a gift fromcolonel grimsson, and pretty flower will become enraged that grimsson makes fun of his name, now wanting to crush him liketiny insect. he will agree to help you defeat the chaos dwarves. as pretty flower starts rousing his army, leave the caves and head back to the palace. after leaving the barendir caves, speak to veldaban, who is hiding next to meike within the crowd of protesters east of the palace, to start the final cutscene. veldaban will appear to be highly uneasy, and he will reveal that meike altered the records so that hreidmar wouldn't be king. the directors will then address the protesters from the balcony, revealing that for the last several hundred years, the consortium was able to justly rule over keldagrim but recent events have changed that, and they have opened up the records chamber in order to crown a new king for keldagrim. hreidmar excitedly awaits for his name to be called, but instead, as meike had altered the records to make veldaban the heir to the throne, veldaban will be crowned as king. meike will claim that it was the easiest thing to do as it only required a few strokes to change. hreidmar refuses to accept that veldaban is the rightful heir and, maddened, threatens to take over the city with his army of chaos dwarves. just as he does so, a black guard soldier comes bearing news that the trolls have defeated the chaos dwarf army. veldaban orders the black guard to seize hreidmar, but he manages to slip away through the crowd and disappears. the scene will change to the top floor of the palace where meike apologises and hands the crown to veldaban, who grudgingly takes it, becoming the king of the dwarves. congratulations,

(note that if you leave the courtroom or logout at any time, all your progress will be lost. as such, you may restart the trial whenever you make a mistake) once you are ready, go back to the courthouse and go down the stairs to start the trial. during the trial, you must call witnesses by talking to thejudgeand question them. the questions available correspond to those asked while in the mansion. to successfully clear anna of her charges, you must rebut the evidence put forward by theprosecutorwithout providing more incriminating information against anna (for example, bringing out testimony which puts anna near lord sinclair's meal before he died). the evidence provided by the prosecutor include: to acquit anna, call the following witnesses and ask them the respective questions: the judge will end the trial and ask for a verdict - the jury releases a not-guilty verdict against anna. successfully saving anna, exit the courtroom through the gate. talk to anna in her cell, who is just as brash as before the trial, and she will tell you how to enter camelot - you must complete the entire dialogue or you will not be able to get into camelot. you must now head to the north-east side of the camelot castle and search the statue near the temple. as you enter the castle, acut sceneensues, wherein anna is seen talking todavidabout setting you up to free anna. they explain they have no intention to help you and call uponmorgan le faye, who appears and knocks you out with her staff. you wake up in a jail alongsidemerlinand the knights of camelot. speak to merlin to gather the situation - all the sinclair kids and morgan le faye have teamed up to usurp arthur and reclaim the camelot castle with the help of theblack knights; morgan has also stolen theholy grailand turnedking arthurinto a granite statue, to be transported elsewhere by the black knights. if you leave the jail, it is possible to reach back by either searching the statue again, or by attempting to enter the grounds of camelot through the main gate. confronting anna and morgan in jail, with the camelot residents. the jail guarded by the black knights. ask merlin what he suggests they should do, and follow through the entire conversation. try to reach the vent at the top of the wall, opposite the prison gate; a funny cutscene shows the knights making a shaky pyramid to help merlin escape through the vent. if you escape through the vent yourself, you will appear at keep le faye. simply exit the front doors and try to open them from the outside to be returned to the prison. speak to all the knights, and ask them if they have anything useful to help them escape. you will get an assortment of items, including anair rune, alaw rune, an emptyvial, a raw or cookedfish, half anapple pie, athread, ajug, anormal log, and a bottle ofvodka. if you received alockpick(or have amaster thief's lockpickon your tool belt), use it on the jail lock; if not, usetelekinetic grabon the guard fixing his hair outside the cell to obtain ahair clip, which you can use to unlock the gate. either way, you will now need to solve a puzzle to unlock the jail lock; the puzzle very closely resembles the popular board game,mastermind. to beat the puzzle, you must set each of the four tumblers at the correct height. a way to do this is to set all tumblers to the lowest height and try the lock. continue these steps until the gate is unlocked. you will emerge at the base of thekeep le faye- arthur's knights will be engaged in battle with therenegade knights.do not try to leavethrough the front door, as morgan le faye will put you back in jail. climb up to the top floor and search the table full of containers; one of these holds the covetedholy grailthat was stolen by morgan, and the correct container hides behind a clue, in the form of a riddle, that you must solve to retrieve it. the correct box is the purple and pink cylinder, second from the right. with the holy grail back in safe hands, all you need to do now is figure out a way to locate and freeking arthurfrom his stone prison. speak towizard crompertyin the north-eastern part ofeast ardougne. cromperty explains that to freeking arthur, you need to use the same process that saved the girl duringone small favour, although this time you will also need to unravel morgan's spell. if you don't have it already, he will give you ananimate rock scrollto use onking arthur, with the holy grail and somegranitein your inventory. you are required to go through all the chat options withwizard cromperty, otherwise you won't be able to freeking arthur. equip the bronze medium helm and iron chainbody (or a set ofblack equipmentor theblack knight captain's armour) and head to theblack knights' fortress. some quick ways to reach the fortress are using thecombat braceletor edgeville lodestone to teleport to the monastery, or theskull of remembranceto directly appear inside the fortress, after which you'll have to descend down to the building entrance. inside, climb down the ladder to the west of the entrance to find king arthur; unequip the bronze med helm and iron chainbody before using the free option on his statue. bring the king up to speed by talking to him and give the guard's uniform - the helm and chainbody - to help him escape. leave the fortress and return to camelot, where you must speak to arthur to finish the quest, and receive your reward. king's ransom is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

the priests know the way to yu'biusk. grubfoot makes everyone promise not to reveal the location of the secret temple. oldak will realise that a cave system is located in that area and will use a sphere to teleport you there. grubfoot can't go as he must go back to goblin village before the generals miss him. you will appear in thegoblin cavewith zanik. head north west until you reach the entrance of a temple blocked by twogoblin guards. you will find someblack mushroomsnear the stairs leading into the temple. pick one or two, and grind the mushroom with an emptyvialin your inventory to produceblack mushroom ink. you can also kill the goblins in the area if you don't already have a goblin mail. talk to the guards and they will allowzanikto pass, but not you, since you are not a goblin. you will have to find another way to enter. you do not need to speak to oldak to progress, but explaining your dilemma to him will redirect you to themakeover mage, as he figures the only way to get past the guards is to become a goblin. head to themakeover magesouth west offalador. a quick method of getting there is by using askills necklaceto teleport to thecrafting guild, which is slightly south of the makeover mage. aclan vexillumis free and can also teleport you to the nearby area. they explain that you will need to make agoblin transmogrification potionfromtoadflaxandpharmakos berries. the mage will provide you with the berries, so it is a good idea to gather a spare in case you miss any steps later on. once you have made the transmogrification potion by mixing the berries in a toadflax potion, unequip everything and head back to thegoblin cave- near the south-eastern fence of thefishing guild. it is also fairly close to the ardougnelodestone. head back to the guards and drink your potion at the stairs leading into the temple to minimise the chances of accidentally getting into combat. the goblin guards will now let you pass, recognising you as one of their kin; you can choose your very own goblin name and avatar at this point. the guards will try to guess your name - if you like it, tell them that they guessed right, or else to guess again. you can not enter the temple while having a follower (pet, summoning familiar, etc.). you will now be inside the temple. talk to thehigh prieston the north wall and you will learn that zanik has been thrown in thehuzamogaarbtribe jail for causing a ruckus. to gain access, dye yourgoblin mailwith theblack mushroom ink. equip the black mail to disguise yourself as a huzamogaarb tribe member and you will be allowed past theguardat the north-east part of the temple. go to the end of the chamber and talk to zanik. ask her how you can rescue her and you will learn that the goblins confiscated her moving-over-distance sphere (dorgesh-kaan sphere) and put it in a crate across the room. simply search the crate and retrieve the sphere. now give it to zanik and she will teleport back to dorgesh-kaan, reminding you that you are now on your own. you can give her your own sphere and take hers out of the crate after she teleports. head back to the high priest and ask about yu'biusk. the high priest wants to test your knowledge about the big high war god before he speaks about yu'biusk. you must answer his questions with the correct reply to proceed. true or false: those who do not believe in the big high war god, whether they are goblins or other races, must die. oh? why? true or false: big high war god chose goblins to be his race because goblins mighty warriors. oh? why you say that? true or false: goblin leaders should be good at planning in order to win battles. why not? prophecy saw some day big high war god send chosen commander. what chosen commander do? after you pass the test, ask him""can you tell me about yu'biusk?"", followed by""where is yu'biusk?"". he will tell you that a deceased prophet namedsnotheadknows the way toyu'biusk. however, he is dead and you can only talk to his spirit in the crypt, an area restricted to ordinary goblins. to gain access to the crypt, you must pickpocket one key each from thepriestsof the six tribes. start by pickpocketing the priest of the black tribe, since your goblin mail is already black. he is located in the cave where zanik was held. you need to dye your goblin mail to match each remaining tribe and gain access to their chambers. you will now need to leave the cave to bleach your armour white, and collect the other dyes if you don't already have them. while in goblin form, you cannot attack or cast spells. to revert back to human form, simply equip any non-goblin item and you will change form, resulting in the goblins throwing you out of the temple. if you've startedmourning's end part iorthe prisoner of glouphrie, you can buy the dyes from the seamstress in the elven town oflletyawith the exception of white. you will need one each ofyellow,blue,orange, andpurpledyes. to enter the tribe wearing the white mail, you need armour which has its original colour bleached, resembling white. talk toaggiein draynor village and ask if she can make dyes for you, and then about the black and white dyes. she says that you need to catch a rawslimy eel, and use it as bait at the fishing spot inhemenster. go to thelumbridge swamp dungeon, and bring a light source and some bait. to the south there is a fishing spot, where you can catch slimy eels. alternatively there are slimy eel fishing spots in thewarforge tunnels(requiring 83archaeologyto access) and inmort myre swamp. if you wish to save time, slimy eels can also be bought at the grand exchange. note that while fishing, you may catch a raw cave eel instead of a slimy eel. these are not the same and cannot be used as bait to catch whitefish. after you have caught a slimy eel, go to thefishing contestspot west of theranging guild. you will be allowed to enter since you have already won the competition before, but only after you have spoken to aggie about the white dye in order to use the option 'i need to catch a hemenster whitefish'. catch awhitefishand bring it to aggie with 5 coins. she will now ""de-colour"" your black goblin mail white. take the dyes, the white goblin mail, the key from the black tribe, and some combat gear to the cavern. unequip everything, and take another sip of your goblin potion to enter the temple. look at the guards of the tribes, and note the colour of their guard; if you cannot clearly see them, examine each guard. since you've already obtained the key from the black tribe, continue now from the white tribe, then for each of the others apply the corresponding dye to the goblin mail. together with the key from the black tribe that you obtained earlier, you will have one key from each of the six tribes: now you can enter the crypt - the big door in the north. once inside, prepare for battle by equipping weapons and armour; you will change from goblin to human when you do this, although you will not be removed from the temple while here. go to the first grave to the left, and say the name of the prophet. he will come out from the ground and start to attack you (level 19). when you have beaten him, ask him where yu'biusk is located. he will tell that he does not know, but hints his ancestor might. ask for the name of his ancestor, and go to the first grave on the right side, and speak that name. if you are having trouble with the dialogue box disappearing after the death of the goblin, switch to an ability-bar setup that is of a combat style different from the one that you are using, so that no abilities are active when the goblin dies. you will be attacked by another priest (level 25). beat him, and ask him the same questions. unfortunately, he does not know either, so ask for his ancestor's name. continue with this zigzag pattern until you have beaten the remaining three prophets (levels 30, 36, 36). the further back in time you go, you'll realise that the older priests have a more expansive knowledge of yu'biusk, are more eloquent than their successors, and are also more adept at fighting, indicating that the current goblin leaders are merely a shadow of their past. the last priest will summon four level 14skoblins, although these can be avoided by using theprotect from magicprayer. if you kill one of these, he will keep summoning a new one, so just focus on the prophet. once you've killed him, speak to him and he will tell you the location of yu'biusk.  after you have obtained the location of yu'biusk, try to exit the room: you will be caught and thrown out of the goblin temple. alternatively just teleport out. return to dorgesh-kaan, and speak withzanik. she is with oldak in his workshop. tell zanik and oldak what you have learned from the priests. oldak tells you that they have found an oddity - a fairy ring - south of the city. after analysing it, he found out that it contains traces of elements similar to that which are found in 'law' runes. the three of you decide to use the fairy ring to try and open a portal to yu'biusk. make sure you have a light source in your inventory and head to the fairy ring south ofdorgesh-kaan(codeajq). to get there, travel south on the same floor level as oldak's workshop, go up the stairs at the end and then up again to reach thedorgesh-kaan agility course. climb down the ladder at the west side of the agility course platform, walk a bit south and take the first corridor to the east. at the end of the corridor, head south and look west for the fairy ring icon. meet up with zanik and oldak, who will ask you to adjust the machine by allotting power to each ring proportional to the area within the ring. the rings, from outer to inner, have diameters of 6, 4, and 2. the equation for a circle's area is: area=π×(diameter2)2 multiplying the diameter byxincreases the area by a factor ofx2. therefore, if the area of the inner ring (diameter 2) is 1, the area of the middle ring (diameter 4) will be(42)2, or 4, and the outer ring (diameter 6) will be(62)2, or 9. meaning, the combination for the machine is9 - 4 - 1. activate the machine and you will automatically be teleported to yu'biusk. walk north-west until you get to some short walls surrounding astrange box. oldak will warn you that you need to return fast, but keep walking. zanik will notice the box and ask you to help her open it. open the strange box, and zanik will be sucked into it. as the portal is closing and you have no way to save zanik yet, you rush back to oldak and return to his workshop. land of the goblins is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: additionally: concept art of thegoblin temple. concept art of thehuzamogaarbtribe prison. cncept art of the goblin priests."

happening in the main temple, something odd even for the border of morytania and misthalin... what's more, drezel has made a curious discovery beneath the well in the paterdomus basement – something that harkens back to morytania's bloody and terrible past. and what of the mysterious safalaan? surely he has more adventurous tasks for an enthusiastic, young and recently-promoted private of the myreque. what new secrets are to be discovered in morytania? can the myreque strike back against the dreaded vyrewatch? talk to themercenary adventurerat theburgh de rott ramblestarting point just east ofpaterdomus. afairy ringcksis very close, as are thecanifis lodestoneandslayer ring. when you talk to the mercenary adventurer, he will ask if you can take him toburgh de rott. before leaving, however, he will make a comment about some suspicious characters he has seen near the temple – seemingly zamorakians and saradominists trying to conceal their identity. question him about the characters – he advises talking todrezel, and will not continue to burgh de rott until you have done what drezel asks. enter the temple and speak to the priest. drezel says he hasn't noticed anything suspicious about the temple, due to the fact that he has been too busy restoring the mausoleum. during the restoration process, he has discovered a secret room, a columbarium (a burial chamber with material possessions stored in wooden compartments). he also discovered some old writing he translated as '...these worldly gains do i leave to whomever saves me from the dread service of drakan, the fate worse than death,' which he finds particularly odd. finally, drezel mentionsivan stromhas been getting rather distant and he hasn't seen him in a while. he asks you to search both the burial chamber and the outside of the temple. go west of drezel, and through the gate. there is a new stairway on the northern wall of the antechamber. go down the stairs and into the columbarium. search a broken wall storage unit just east from the stairs. there is a shiny object inside that appears to sparkle. upon closer examination, the object seems to be ablood talisman, but a key is required to open the storage unit. go back up the stairs, exit the mausoleum by the west exit and enter thepaterdomus. climb the staircases until you reach the2ndfloor[uk]3rdfloor[us]. a cutscene of the suspicious characters ensues. you quickly hide behind the wall and eavesdrop on the group. sixmysterious peopleare standing by a blackboard with strategic marks on them, with two of them arguing with each other. they mention how they plan to do something about theedicts of guthix, when you are suddenly spotted. the leaders quickly teleport away and leave two zamorakian bodyguards to kill you then clear the room. you must fight two level 77 guards,fistandantilusandzaromark sliver– the former uses magic and melee, the latter ranged and melee. the guards can use protection prayers against melee, ranged, and magic, but not against necromancy. high level players shouldn't need multiple styles as the guards will go down quickly even when praying against the player's combat style. if players are finding this fight difficult, bringing multiple combat styles may help to work around the guards' prayers. using aring of recoilorpoison(they exclaim 'gack! poison!' when poisoned) can be used to bypass their prayers, albeit slowly. it is possible to leave and return, but the guards have to be defeated to proceed. the guards only start praying after being hit for the first time, after which they will constantly adapt to your attack style. dual-wielding a melee weapon and a ranged or magic weapon and usinglegacy modeis an effective (and simple) way to circumvent the guards' prayer swapping. when a guard is defeated, he will fall to his knee and stop fighting. therefore, it's recommended to focus on one of them first before dealing with the other. when both guards are out of health, they'll get up and teleport away. once they have left, search the crude table in the north-west alcove for clues to find a tornbook pageand aglove. the glove is of distinct saradominist design, while the book page is from a zamorakian map book and depictsmisthalin. return to drezel, who is troubled by the ordeal and takes the two pieces of evidence for safekeeping. he advises you to

bodyguards escorting the mysterious adventurer return to the adventurer and agree to bring him to burgh de rott. this escort is exactly the same as anyburgh de rott ramble. you should take a silver weapon, ideally arod of ivandis, to deal with potentialjuvinates, and may wish to take food for the adventurer. if you don't want to engage any monsters in combat, the mercenary adventurer can foresee events, so simply click ""continue"" on the path (and not ""quick-continue"") to see what encounter a path will feature. which paths are taken is not important. simply escort him down to burgh de rott; if you have to escape an event at any point, you will have to start over. once you arrive, the adventurer reveals himself to be a fellow myreque member, whom you had originally helped trek to the temple,ivan strom. follow him back to the myreque base under the old inn and talk to veliaf. he will be quite angry that ivan tricked you, as he is young and needs protection due to being the myreque's 'special charge'. tell him about the plans to take out theedicts of guthix; he reckons they must be part of amorytanian splinter groupand you decide to keep your eyes open for further activity. afterwards, ask him about the next job, at which point he gives you acrateof provisions for the sanguinesti order. veliaf also mentions a new weapon meant to take out the vyrewatch being in development. go to the boat to the south-east of the town and row it tomeiyerditch. go tosafalaanin the myreque base any way you wish. the easiest way is to get captured by a vyrewatch and get sent to the mines. the player who starts from the mines may follow thethe shortcut guide. once in the building outlined climb up the ladder, jump across the floorboard to the east, climb down the stairs, push the wall south of the stairs, push the decorated wall with the sickle symbol, finally open the trapdoor on the rug. in the northern most section of the hideout you'll find safalaan. safalaan, being busy, asks you to talk to fellow member,flaygian screwte, the scientist, in the same room. do so and ask him about the research he's doing. he tells players that the book ofhaemalchemyhe managed to translate suggests that the vyrewatch have limited precognitive abilities, allowing them to predict an opponent's moves and easily evade them. the best way to beat them is to create a new, completely unpredictable weapon, whose attacks the vampyres would not see coming, out ofsilvthrill. ask him if you can help and he tells you to talk to the local fighters for advice on such a weapon, as well as find a secondary source to back up their claim. talk toandiess juip,kael forshaw, ormekritus a'hara. they immediately advise you to use a flail, a weapon very difficult to master and quite unpredictable, described in abookabout weaponry. search the middle bunk bed on the north wall of the eastern room (near mekritus) and you'll find this book. read it and remember which page mentioned flails, then give it to flaygian. he is annoyed by the fact that he would need to read a whole book, so he asks which part he needs to read instead. answer with the page number where the book begins to describe flails. this number is different for each player. he reads it, then agrees to create a new silvthrill flail, using therod of ivandisas a base. realising this will certainly require afurnace, he recalls an old story about a furnace in one of the northern houses in meiyerditch, even further north than the laboratory you found. he suggests to investigate it to see if it is serviceable, or, indeed, exists, and adds that you may need to use some other houses to gain access to the building though. he provides a hammer and ten nails to construct a makeshift ladder should that be necessary. exit the base and head to the northernmost part ofmeiyerditch. look for a house with the mass of debris due east of the mine exit and north of the lab. this is the house with the furnace, but the door is locked. enter the house south of the locked house with the furnace and debris. using your nails and hammer, make the wooden post in the centre climbable and go up. jump across the floorboards to the east, then to the north. jump west through the damaged wall, which caves in. climb up the ladder. search the trough first to see the furnace below – it is completely covered in rubble. optionally, you may return to flaygian now for him to tell you to try and repair the furnace, if possible. from the top room in the building with the furnace, take a piece of coal from thecoal barrel, a tinderbox and a bronze pickaxe (tool belt items suffice). go to the bottom floor and right-click the mass of debris to excavate it. once the furnace is clear, use thecoalon the furnace and light it. the furnace is now functional once more! return to flaygian. he tells you to attach a silvthrill chain to the rod of ivandis, and think of something to use as a flail-head – your eye then catches the large poster portraying a sickle. return to the furnace (or use another furnace if preferred). deposit the bars into your metal bank, then click on the silver bars to make one or moresilvthril chains. if all four bars are deposited, or the player already has enough silver and mithril bars in their metal bank, then the default option will be to make more than one chain. only one is needed for the quest, however, and the player will get to keep the ivandis flail (the weapon the chain is used in making) at the end of the quest. return to flaygian and talk to him, then use the blessed sickle on him – he concludes it is perfect, as the sickle's shape would make the flail even more unpredictable. he takes the chain and sickle, then tells you to talk tosafalaan. flaygian in the myreque base jumping into the damaged wall fixing the furnace safalaan introduces you toandiess juipandkael forshaw. the three of them want to investigate the laboratory and would appreciate your assistance. there is a heavy door there that cannot be opened and forcing it might cause a cave-in. he then asks the player to meet them at the laboratory and to help them search it. kael suggests bringing some items to deal with the door and he and andiess hint at a saw by saying it has a very good quality 'construction'. if you don't already have one in your tool belt, pick up a saw from the tool racks near flaygian and proceed to the laboratory, which is south-south-east of the furnace (recall that the laboratory is downstairs from the building with the slashed tapestry).  upon entering the laboratory, a short cutscene plays, where you see safalaan, andiess, and kael dead. examine one of their bodies lying next to the broken rune case just west of the staircase. they will suddenly get up and scream, revealing that playing dead was just a practical joke. they would like you to come up with a solution for the solid door. search the door to the south-west and you will be given the option to use the saw (one on tool belt works) to make a hole in it. do so and go down the long and winding tunnel beyond the door (the three myreque members go ahead of you) to a chamber with aggressiveskeletal handsandmutated bloodveldbut ignore these side caverns. continue through the long passage to the north-west to reach a large room with coffins and ""strange stones"" in the familiar shape of a runecrafting altar in the back of it. don't continue down the passage to the jutting wall shortcut. safalaan and the myreque fighters lay dead... zombies! enter the room to see a cutscene with safalaan and the bodyguards. they will ask you to search the strange rocks in the northern part of the chamber while they do the rest. when you search the rocks, they will feel familiar somehow. if you did not bring a spell tablet, you may search the corpse next to the rocks to receive some runes for thelvl-2 enchantspell. you should do this now, before you speak to safalaan, to avoid a trip back through the tunnels. upon searching the corpse next to the strange rocks you will earn thebloodstained treasureachievement. report to safalaan, who fears they may be in danger. a cutscene plays in which two vyrewatch ambush the four of you. andiess is immediately slain when attempting to protect safalaan, and kael quickly retreats, urging you to follow. you and safalaan remain to be finished off, and safalaan grows weaker by the second. suddenly, however, he starts levitating and emits a strange, cyan glow, which is amplified before producing a large explosion of power. the two vyrewatch are deterred, and a severely exhausted safalaan begs you to get him back to the base, where you automatically head. talk to safalaan in the myreque base. he wants to keep what happened quiet. he gives the player the materials for theivandis flail, as flaygian has angrily dumped the stuff on his desk and left in frustration: the chain, the sickle, therod of ivandis, and a cut emerald; ensure that you have 4 free backpack slots, or he won't give the items to you. get achiselfrom the tool rack (tool belt works). follow these steps carefully, as you cannot get some items back fromsafalaan. return to safalaan. he asks you to test the new flail by killing a vyrewatch. thevyrewatcharen't very strong and their attacks are very inaccurate. protectionprayersorfoodcan be used if necessary. make sure that you kill the vyrewatch within the meiyerditch area, since if you kill one in burgh de rott, it will not count and you won't get the corpse. go outside and kill a vyrewatch. when it dies, it drops avyre corpse. take it and return to safalaan. delighted, he then orders you to return to veliaf in burgh de rott and show them. as flaygian has not returned yet, take the corpse to drezel as well. safalaan's strange power using the flail of ivandis to kill a vyrewatch in meiyerditch return toburgh de rottand tellveliafthe good news. you can tell him exactly how you made the flail and that you killed a vyrewatch with it, its corpse now hard but light, and he advises to go to drezel to find a way to dispose of the corpse. you may optionally also tell him about the incident with safalaan and the vyrewatch, but he will not believe any of it. then ask him:what should i do now? return todrezelat the paterdomus temple. he examines the corpse and is shocked that there's a tormented soul in the body. you recallsomething similar, but can't quite pin it down. askdrezelwhat to do next and he suggests going to thecolumbariumto meditate so you can hopefully remember what to do with the soul. he also mentions that his research has been going well. go through the gate west of drezel and down the stairs to the north into the columbarium. useteak pyre logsorbetteron a funeral pyre, followed by the corpse, then light it. you receive anornate tomb key. if you leave the logs on a funeral pyre for too long without adding the corpse, they disappear, so don't delay. the corpse also disappears with the logs after a while so light it as soon as you place it down. the key appears on a post of the funeral pyre. if you did not get a key then go talk to drezel and try again. go to the locker where you will find ablood talisman. it’s east of the ladder. use the key to open the storage and get the talisman. drezel suddenly comes in to congratulate you for solving the secret of the columbarium, and blesses the talisman so that it can be used safely. go back upstairs, where drezel is happy to see you. he explains that he has figured out that those who could not escapehallowvalewhen the vampyres invaded participated in a religious ceremony to save their souls; when freed, the saviour would gain the key to their worldly possessions. he then advises going back to veliaf. return to burgh de rott and tell veliaf what happened at paterdomus. he will be amazed by the vyre cremation and the blood talisman before congratulating you on a job well done. congratulations, quest complete.  legacy of seergaze is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

agree to help ungadulu. at the northwest edge of the jungle are three rocks that form a triangle; search one of the rocks to crawl through a narrow opening. if you succeed, you'll find yourself in theviyeldi caveswith theshamanin the centre, surrounded by a flame wall. investigate the ring of fire and talk to ungadulu, who informs you that only pure water can extinguish the flames. next, search the various items in the cave to obtain ungadulu's notes: ascrawled notefrom the crate;a scribbled noteon the table; and ascrumpled noteon the bed. reading them tells you how the shaman had prepared to summon his ancestors and pay homage to them, but fell prey to an evil presence in the cave. go back outside the cave, and call gujuo with the bull roarer again. being a local, he directs you to a pool of sacred water at the heart of the jungle. the water, however, should only be carried in a special vessel made of 'sun metal', the instructions for which hesketchesfor you. return to the cave and search for a crevice hidden behind the north-east bookshelves. squeeze through it and cross the cavern to the large, ancient gate; the gate must be picked to proceed forward. failure may cause the lockpick to break, so be sure to bring extras; ahair cliphas a higher success rate than a lockpick. a master thief's lockpick is the best option because it is unbreakable and can be stored on the toolbelt. a possible trick to save lockpicks is to click away when the message tells you that you failed, just before the lockpick would break, preventing it from being destroyed. note that you will need to pick the lock every time you come back. once the gate is unlocked,smash-to-bitsthe boulders in your path to reach a second gate. failure temporarily reduces your mining level. this next ancient gate must be forced open using raw strength. failure temporarily reduces your strength level. beyond the door are level 77death wings. killing one is not necessary to finish the quest, but it completesdeadwing, ahard karamja achievement. head further into the cave, andjump-overthe low, jagged wall. on the south-west section of the cavern is a marked wall;searchthe wall to discover a riddle: use, in this specific order, onesoul,mind,earthand twolaw runeson the wall; the wall-door unlocks and you can now pass through it. on the other side of the door is a large cavern, which contains a number of stalagmites sitting in several pools of water.searchone of the stalagmites (carved rocks) to uncover another riddle. this time, you must use a certain gem on each stalagmite. refer to the map in the previous section for the layout. a quicker way of doing this is to drop the gem directly next to the rock and it will automatically glide towards the rock. a message saying ""as you drop the gem, it slowly glides over to the sharp rock. and gently floats above it, rotating slowly. the""gem name""glows and starts spinning as it hovers above the rock. the gem soon begins to fade."" when all of the gems are in place, you are levitated to the centre of the cavern and treated to a light show that leaves behind abinding book. this book allows players to bless vials, enabling it to hold pure water, and also counts as a stackable ranged projectile useful for fighting demons. if you log out or otherwise do not pick up the binding book during this process, simply search any of the stalagmites to restart it. the binding book cannot be reclaimed from a bookcase until you have picked it up for the first time. after obtaining the binding book, head back up to the surface and call gujuo using the bull roarer. you will learn you need a special vessel, thegold bowl, to be blessed before you are able to collect the holy water. with at least two gold bars in the inventory, any anvil will do, try to forge agold bowl. it is possible to fail, so you may need to bring more bars. note: the game won't give you the option to craft a gold bowl if you already have one in your inventory innew varrock. you will first need to access new varrock through the fountain portal in varrock whiledimension of disasteris active, then destroy the gold bowl. once discarded, leave new varrock. the option to craft a gold bowl when interacting with an anvil and at least two gold bars in your inventory should appear normally. to hold pure water without corrupting it, the bowl must be purified. use the bull roarer, while in the kharazi jungle, to call gujuo again and ask him to bless it for you to becomeblessed gold bowl. failing this will reduce prayer points by 50. now, go to thepool of pure waterat the centre of the jungle. chop the reeds along the edge to get somehollow reeds, which you need a machete to cut, and use these to siphon some water into the bowl. to create anenchanted vial, right-click the binding book to select ""enchant vials"" option while holding an empty vial in your inventory. you can now fill enchanted vials withgolden bowlone at a time. you may also use the hollow reed on the pool to fill the vials (the ability to fill them by using the golden bowl is only unlocked once the quest is completed). the water can evaporate in the jungle heat, and if you plan to use ranged attacks, it is recommended to enchant some vials and fill them with holy water. blessing the golden bowl through a sacred ritual the pool containing pure water prepare for the battle ahead and head back to ungadulu's cave. pour the bowl of pure water on the octagram fire to step through unharmed and use the binding book on the shaman to release him from the demon, namelynezikchened. do not talk to ungadulu before fighting the demon, or your melee stats will be drained. nezikchened is level 84 and drains prayer at the beginning of the battle. it attacks primarily with melee, but will resort to magic if hiding behind an obstacle. players can lower its stats by attacking it withsilverlightordarklight(melee) or some vials ofholy water(ranged). the demon will cast one lastfire blastspell just before dying. once nezikchened is defeated, speak to ungadulu, who rewards you for your efforts with someyommi tree seeds. it is a good idea to use thedrop trickto obtain at least six yommi tree seeds, as the seeds often do not grow on the first attempt. finally, ask him how to get out safely and he'll cast a spell to protect you from the eternal fire. head back up to the surface and call gujuo, for directions on crafting a new totem. he instructs you to plant the seeds infertile soiland germinate it in pure water. first, use theblessed bowl of wateron theyommi tree seedsin order to germinate them. after germinating the seeds, use them in fertile soil (they look like light spots on indented ground in the jungle) and you'll receive a message saying that you need pure water to make them grow. try to siphon some water into your bowl, and you'll be told that the pool has run dry; summon gujuo again and inform him of your predicament. he says that the underground source has probably been blocked off by the evil spirits. apparently, the source resides in a very dark, scary place, guarded by undead adventurers who also sought the fountain of pure water. gujuo tells you to create abravery potion, made fromclean ardrigalandclean snake weed, before trying to replenish the water pool. if you don't have them, collect the required herbs by searching the short leafy palm trees (near one of the brimhaven shortcuts south of the town) for thegrimy ardrigaland marshy jungle vines (north of cairn isle) for the grimy snake weed. clean the weeds. use the ardrigal on a vial of water to makeardrigal mixture. use the snake weed on the ardrigal mixture to make abravery potion, consumed in a single dose. do not drink the potion yet. go back to ungadulu's cave and past all the obstacles to the chamber where you found the binding book. head north to the door and investigate it for yet another riddle. cast anycharge orbspell on the door, until it opens, and walk through it. you will need to do this every time you pass through. beyond the door is a room with a winch and severalbarrelsin it. it doesn't require any interactions to progress in the quest, however, if you've forgotten a rope, you can smash the barrels to get one (it might take several attempts to get a rope this way), although there is a chance to have your stats reduced or take a small amount of damage when doing so. use a rope on the winch, drink thebravery potion, and climb down the rope; you may fail and slip doing so, taking 180 points of damage. if you attempt to climb down the rope without first drinking the bravery potion, your character will refuse to climb down and the rope will disappear. however, you do not need to get another rope; simply search the winch to unwind the original rope. you should find yourself on top of a long, winding ridge, sprinkled with rocky projections. attempting to take theblue hatat the top invokes a skeletal apparition ofviyeldi, a wizard cursed to protect the source, after dying in search for it. climb over the rocky ledges to get to the bottom of the ridge. failure results in one of the following: once at the bottom, you must defeat three spectral monsters namedranalph devere(level 63),irvig senay(level 70), andsan tojalon(level 70). talk to each of them to engage in combat; usingprotect from meleemakes the battles fairly easy. you should get alump of crystal,chunk of crystal, and ahunk of crystalafter defeating all three of them. take the pieces of crystal to the furnace in the northeast part of the chamber and use each one on it to make aheart crystal. ""look-at"" the heart crystal to read the next clue –""bring life to the dragon's eye."" head to the mossy rock surrounded by crumbling walls, just southwest of the furnace, and place the heart crystal on it. this should activate the crystal, allowing it to be used in the heart-shaped recess near the barrier to the south. on the other side of the barrier is, finally, the source of the pure water. pass across the barrier and west past thelesser demonsuntil you reach the stream, blocked by three boulders. try to push one, and a spirit namedechned zekinappears, saying that he's being tortured and begs you to help him by killingviyeldi. you may notice that ""echned zekin"" is an anagram of ""nezikchened""; agree to help regardless and he'll give you adark daggerto kill viyeldi with. at this point, there are two paths you can choose between. if you wish to acquire both modified versions of the dark dagger, you can start with either of the paths and then switch to the other, making use of thedrop trick. make sure to do so before pushing the boulder to summon echned zekin. also note that your final battle will depend on the initial path that you chose. this path involves complying with echned zekin's request. it takes a shorter time to complete as players do not need to exit the dungeon. however, it makes the upcoming battles a little harder, because the demon is still able to drain your prayer and can summon the three guardians in the third battle against him. go back to the ridge and walk back up to the very top. wield the dagger, take the blue hat, and stab viyeldi, killing him and changing your weapon to aglowing dagger. once he is dead, head back and push a boulder to get echned zekin to appear. use the glowing dagger on him; he reveals himself to be nezikchened and attacks you, draining your prayer. this path involves reneging on the agreement with echned zekin. it takes longer to complete and also requires another orb and runes for a charge orb spell, since you must exit and return to the caves. leave the cave; if necessary, go to a bank and get another unpowered orb and runes for the charge orb spell, and restock on food and potions. return to ungadulu back at the entrance and use the dagger on him. he recognises the evil in the dagger and uses it to create aholy force, which can be used on the demon to prevent it from draining your prayer. head back to echned zekin's cave and push a boulder to make him appear. use the holy force to compel echned zekin to reveal itself to be nezikchened, causing him to attack you. the fight with nezikchened is similar to the first one. after you defeat him, push the boulders out of the way of the water's flow, restoring the surface pool. you can refill your golden bowl with sacred water right here – after you push aside the boulder, a spring of sacred water appears. make sure your bowl is filled; if necessary, use the seeds on the bowl to germinate them, and fill the bowl again. each set of seeds can produce three saplings, so there are three chances to get the following right. note: you will get the message ""you will need a very sharp hatchet..."" while trying to plant the germinated seeds if you do not have a rune hatchet in your tool belt or inventory. get a rune hatchet and try again. go back to the surface and head to the water pool. plant a sapling in any one of the brown,fertile soilspots around the jungle - there's one just northwest of the pool. water the sapling with pure water to make it grow. if you need to refill your bowl, you can reuse the pool as it is no longer blocked by a boulder. if you don't water it in a timely fashion, the yommi tree sapling will die shortly after being planted. if this happens, you'll have to remove the dead yommi tree by using a hatchet on it, and wait for the ""damaged earth"" to turn back fertile (roughly a minute) before trying again. the tree should grow in about ten seconds. once the tree gets to full size, immediately chop it down and shape it by clicking it, before it rots. keep chopping the fallen tree until it becomes ayommi totem. when you're done, ""lift"" the totem pole into your inventory. once you have the totem, prepare for a fight and go to any of the locations of the older, possessed totems; one is located just east of the pool, but there are some all around the forest. to start the fight, use your newly made totem pole on a standing one. nezikchened, once again, drains prayer when he fights you, and uses relatively more effective melee and magic attacks. once the demon falls for the last time, use the new totem on the impure totem again. gujuo appears and rewards the player with agilded totem. go back to the guild with the completedradimus notesand the gilded totem, and hand them over to radimus erkle in his office. he wants you to meet him in the main hall, so enter through the guild doors and talk to him again to be admitted into the legends' guild. congratulations, quest complete!

discovery oftarddiad. the central focus of thequestis the return of the crystalline goddess of the elves,seren, by helping the elven elders find and reunite her component shards. travel across gielinor and beyond – to the elven homeworld of tarddiad. expect fiendish puzzles, challenging combat and some truly tough choices. whatever the outcome, your part in these events will be pivotal in the ongoing saga of gielinor's sixth age. to start the quest, talk toelunedin the ithell district ofprifddinas, north of theplayer-owned houseportal next to thesinging bowl. the screen will start shaking as she questions seren's arrival, worrying that the city will collapse. she requires your help in forming seren. go upstairs in thetower of voices, found north-east of the lodestone in the centre of prifddinas, and all the clan leaders will be there, along withserenin the middle. they will debate whether they should reform seren or not, and they will give you the option whether to reform seren or not. it doesn't matter which you choose; either option will result in seren's reformation. after choosing, they will wonder as to how they will reform seren. lady trahaearn will suggest using theenchanted key. give her the key and she will attune it to moments in time relating to seren. a new key can be obtained fromjorralin hisoutpost. now you must follow the path which the enchanted key takes you. this can be found by feeling the key, but the position is the same for everyone: it will lead you toguthix's caveat guthix's corpse, easily accessible through thesixth-age circuit(right-click the ring and select 'teleport' and then the 'guthix's shrine' option) ormodified diviner's headwearteleport. if you haven't yet unlocked the teleport to the world gate, speak to the guthixian high druid to do so. upon arrival, go down the stairs on either side of the high druid and stand by the druidess on the platform in front of guthix's corpse and rub the key; you will be transported back in time. guthixwill be there. talk to him and pick any dialogue options. he will talk about theenchanted key's origins and how to restore seren. he suggests reconstructing her major shards through elven magic and replacement crystal. however, guthix notices that they are being spied on. he suggests that you find out who it is before you leave. go up the steps and findhalunedto the north-west. she will recognise the player frommeeting history, and you may talk to her to find out that she is the twin ofeluned. while trying to talk to her further, she will teleport away, and guthix will summon you again. guthix believes that eluned is her twin, and because of that, the player will need to make a difficult choice later in the quest because they are both shards of seren. after talking to guthix, you will teleport back into the present. return to the top of the tower of voices, where the leaders will mention that each pair of clans hold one of the major shards of seren. amlodd and hefin, known as the spiritualists, hold one shard. crwys and meilyr, known as the naturalists, hold another. cadarn and iorwerth, the military, hold a third, and ithell and trahaearn, the artisans, hold the final one. talk to the clan leaders in the respective groups to find out where the shard may be hidden. some of the leaders will redirect you to the other leader due to an issue (age, trust, etc.), so you should talk to the elder clan leaders to save time. the shards can be collected in any order. theelixir of revealmentpotion is obtained from mixing agrand defence potionwith awintercup mushroomand abloodcap mushroom. talk tocoedenin thecrwysdistrict. he will tell you that you need the wintercup mushroom, which he will give you after he tells a story. your character will start to fall asleep during the story; to stay awake, click on the elven clan icons that appear on the screen as he automatically narrates. if you should fail, once the eyelid screen has gone black, you can movecoeden's chat screen to see the icons better. in the legacy mode interface, click the red button beneath the home teleport icon in the top right corner of the screen to leave the black view. the bloodcap mushroom can be found just west of thetirannwnmushroom farming patch.teleport to the tirannwnlodestoneoutside of prifddinas and enter the dense forest to the west. the mushroom and farming patch is to the south. once both mushrooms have been collected, use one of them on the potion to create theelixir of revealment. the potion must then be used on the shards around anactivecrystal treeto reveal a cave entrance. if you have access to themax guildgarden and have level 94 woodcutting, you can attune one of the portals to take you to the active crystal tree. once you find it, use the potion on one of the shards around the tree and a hole will appear in the ground. climb down and take theseren shard of harmonyfrom the roots. travel tolletya(teleporting with acrystal teleport seedor by a similar method) and equip the trahaearn exoskeleton set. investigate thewellin front of the ithell statue, and climb into it.trahaearn automaton mk vis encountered guarding access to the shard, and it will not let you pass. wearing the trahaearn exoskeleton set makes it confuse you for lady trahaearn, but it will still ask you some questions to ensure you are not an impostor. once the questions are successfully answered, the automaton will go into a passive observation mode in a corner of the room. take theseren shard of prudencefrom the singing bowl in the room. threelight coresare required, which are obtained from cleansingshadow coresin the amlodd district. shadow cores are an uncommon drop from all types of shadow creatures, and since you are not guaranteed to acquire alight corefrom cleansing, it can take up to an hour to get 3 light cores. if you have the shared knowledge buff from memorial to guthix active, or are wearing the sixth-age circuit, you will not receive light cores from cleansing. the shadow creatures hit with very high and very accurate melee attacks. if this option is not feasible, shadow cores can be pickpocketed fromamlodd workers, though it may take just as long and will also require 94thieving. walk up to thehefin cathedraland there will be a chatbox option to purify the corrupted seren stone upon entry. if this chatbox does not appear, it can be triggered by attempting to cleanse the corrupted seren stone. lady hefin will start the ritual by using the same poses from theserenity posts, followed by an incantation, both of which must be copied correctly. three poses then incantations are used, which will increase to four and five respectively as you progress through the ritual. if your incantation is incorrect, you must restart and copy the poses again; you will not have to restart back at three poses/incantations, should you accidentally fail the ones requiring four or five. if you have difficulty memorising the incantation, you can write down the first letter of each word to help you through the process (the letters are different for everyone). after completing the incantation, you will be given aseren shard of wisdom. make sure you have talked to arianwyn and received baxtorian's journal. travel to thebarbarian outpostwith agames necklace, and run south to thebaxtorian fallswithglarial's amuletand enter thewaterfall dungeonunder the falls. the dungeon can be accessed by boarding the log raft west ofalmera, using the rope on the rock across the water directly south of you, and using the rope again on the dead tree to get onto a cliff with the entrance. alternatively, you can use ahoardstalker ringordungeoneering capeto teleport to the entrance of the baxtorian falls resource dungeon (waterfall fire giant dungeon), which does not require the amulet or a rope. go into the eastern room and search the northern crates fora key. if you previously had the key in your bank and attempt to use it, the door will not open; you must search the crates. readbaxtorian's journalif you haven't already, then go into the north-western room and open the door.arianwynwill be inside. investigate thestatue of baxtorian. arianwyn will speak some elvish words (meaning ""awaken, baxtorian, your people need you"") that will awaken the statue of baxtorian, who mentions the song of restoration which can be used to restore seren. he only remembers one part of it out of four, however, so you still need to learn the rest. he will then turn thestatue of glarialinto the military clans'seren shard of integrityand allow you to take it. return to the tower of voices with the four shards. a cutscene will occur where seren needs your help, and you will obtain the second piece of the song. go back into the tower of voices and return the shards to each leader. however, lord iorwerth will mention that the shard of thedark lord(haluned) andelunedneed to be used as well. go tomorvranin the iorwerth district and ask to be taken to thegrand library. go west through the door to enter the grand library. in the very south-west corner on the edge of the cliff, click on the seren shard. you will be given a choice to include the dark seren shard in the restoration of seren. if you choose to include it, you will take the shard; if you choose not to include it, you will kick it into the abyss. after making your decision, return to the tower of voices. with all the main crystals collected, the only thing left to recreate seren are filler crystals. the elders will suggest to visit their homeworld of tarddiad for them, although it may be dangerous since no one's been there for centuries. teleport to theworld gatewith thesixth-age circuit, or alternatively teleport to the eagles' peak lodestone and run south. interact with the controls directly in front of your character to change the gate's destination. rotate the dials until a number ""1"" is presentedonthe gate (not to be mistaken with the straight line and backwards 1). this is the portal totarddiad. step through it and a cutscene will occur where seren regrets going to gielinor. the third piece of the song of restoration is remembered here.elunedwill then be seen following your character into the gate and she will say how beautiful the home of the elves is, warn you to be prepared for danger, and tell you that you will need to gather 50tarddian crystals. after continuing a short way along the path, a short cutscene will play, showing you a level 112crystal shapeshifter, who will then attack you. it is much more challenging than its combat level suggests, using rapid, hard-hitting attacks and changing style depending on your armour and any protection prayer. however, you do not need to kill it - if you leave via the world gate or by any other teleport methods such as an emergency teleport, it will despawn. crystal fragmentscan be obtained from miningsolid crystal, choppingbranching crystalor fishingfloating crystals. both fragments and complete crystals stack. level 75 is needed in the respective skill to mine, cut, and fish for the fragments. they can be exchanged withangofin the north-east corner of tarddiad at a rate of 3 crystal fragments to 1 tarddian crystal, meaning you will need to gather a total of 150 fragments. you will also get the final piece of the song of restoration by speaking to her. there are also several more (non-aggressive) crystal shapeshifters around tarddiad who drop two complete crystals upon death, making them faster than the skilling methods of gathering. angof has a toggle option to increase the amount of shapeshifters in the area, and make them aggressive towards you. going through the dialogue with angof, she will tell you that the few elves who remained on tarddiad after seren left missed her, and they turned to the natural crystals on their world, using magic to infuse the crystals within themselves, as the crystals had absorbed a sliver of seren's essence, enough to temporarily satisfy the elves' need. she refers to their intense need for seren as ""the sickness"", with the physical and mental effects apparent in the insane crystal shapeshifters. she says that she blames and feels she should hate seren and the elves on gielinor who left with her. in the house behind angof, there is a crate which can be searched forher diary. although you cannot take it, you can read it. there are also three journals that contain additional lore, which are not necessary for the quest, however, reading all three completes the achievementsome old dusty journalswhich is a requirement for themaster quest cape. in the north-west corner, inside the middle building, there is aboulderyou can search for theancient tarddian journal. to the north (on the west bank of the river), at the end of a faded path, abushwill yield theweathered tarddian journal. acrystal formationabutting the top of the southernmost stairs (small click area) can be searched for thedusty tarddian journal. once you are done, you may speak with eluned at the world gate or by angof for a fast teleport back to the tower of voices, or just use the prifddinas lodestone. once 50 crystals have been collected, return to the tower of voices and the restoration ceremony will begin. you have the choice to sacrifice eluned to complete seren, or keep her alive. regardless of your decision, seren will appear, but she will not be conscious. she will appear to you then in a cutscene, and tell you that she is more than a shell of crystal, and you need to take her tofreneskaesomahcan revive her. agree to go to freneskae when you are ready. a cutscene will ensue once you are teleported, taking seren through freneskae. do not skip the cutscene, as you will have to re-enter the tower of voices and start the cutscene again. aface maskisnotneeded for this part. as you reach the cradle, aforce muspahwill attack you, followed by a second one shortly. since you are carrying seren you cannot fight them and will need to avoid their attacks. you will be stuck in walk-mode during this time. just keep moving and you shouldn't get hit. after a short while,zaroswill appear and banish the muspahs, and will say that it wasn't the right idea to bring her here and put her in danger. he will tell you that you can reforge her soul in theelder halls, but will make you agree to not reveal that he was involved. he will then take you there. you are required to direct two beams of light, from the centre, onto the fractured shards at the outer edge of the puzzle. you do this by rotating crystals which refract the beams. the crystals are divided in three rings, an outer ring, middle ring and core ring - if the compass is pointing north the rings can be seen clearer. rotating any crystal in a ring turns all the crystals in the ring identically. rotating any crystal in a ring also rotates the crystals in one or both of the other crystal rings in the opposite direction. the crystals can be turned clockwise or anticlockwise, and there are eight turns in a full circle (i.e. n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw). the turn effects are explained below. turn mechanism turning any crystal anticlockwise simply reverses the above. for the mathematically inclined this means each operation may be considered as vector addition. in the formula below thenvariables are how many times you have clicked rotate clockwise (minus the times rotated clockwise) and the left-hand side gives the final position. it doesn't matter what order you move the rings in. (core rotationmiddle rotationouter rotation)=ncore(+1−10)+nmiddle(−1+1−1)+nouter(−10+1)=(+1−1−1−1+100−1+1)(ncorenmiddlenouter) note: the matrix of the last equality is non-singular and hence it can be inverted quite easily to get thenvector as subject of the formula. if you mess up, you can click on seren to reset the puzzle. there are four puzzles in total. after completing each puzzle, a cutscene will occur. light puzzle solution puzzle 1: puzzle 2: puzzle 3: puzzle 4: after the light puzzles are completed, more dialogue betweenserenand the player will ensue in which more insight toserenandzaros' relationship is given. the player will eventually be given the option to teleport to thetower of voicesor to theworld gate. regardless of your decision, return to the tower of voices where seren will tell the elders that they are now the rightful rulers of prifddinas, and appoints the player as their champion. congratulations! quest complete!  the light within is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: the icon of an unreleasedseren prayer. the icon of an unreleasedseren prayer. the icon of an unreleasedseren spell. the icon of an unreleasedseren spell. the icon of an unreleasedseren spell."

choose whether to spring the trap or call the retreat. regardless of the choice made, a cutscene will occur, where drakan learns of safalaan's heritage, claims that the person who killed his father is amongst his allies, and safalaan activating his icyenic powers. a second will show the player and the rest of the myreque being caught, dragged, and put into prison cells. leave the cell and open the other 5 cell doors within the area to free the myreque members. each door will damage the player for 10% of their maximum life points. after freeing all the myreque members, the portcullis leading to the next chamber will open. enter the chamber and free vanescula and mornid by unlocking the seal that is causing them to be trapped in the bloodletters. as with the earlier crypt door puzzle, the player must rotate the concentric rings of the puzzle so that their markings join up. in this puzzle rotating a ring causes the smaller, adjacent ring to rotate as well. rotating the centre ring causes the outer ring to rotate as well. players can talk topolmafi ferdygristo reset the puzzle. start from the outside and work your way in. after freeing the vampyres, the next portcullis will open. enter the next chamber and talk to safalaan. he will tell the player abouta mysterious prisonerwho has been trapped beneath the dungeon floor by lord drakan. go up the stairs and leave using the dungeon exit. veliaf asks the player to explore the area. go into the room on the eastern side of the corridor and take from the butchery table to obtainmysterious jerky. the player can take up to 20 mysterious jerky, which is stackable and heals 2,000 life points.ivan stromwill give the player a book,a taste of hope. enter the room on the western side of the corridor and talk to vanescula and mornid. enter the room south of the corridor. you will need to match up each myreque member with the blood lock corresponding to their emotional state. investigate a blood lock to assign a myreque member to it. the correct matches are: unlock the tithing door and escape through the cellar exit. polmafi ferdygrisattempts to teleport out of the area - but the myreque's teleports are not working. veliaf asks the player to lead the group out of the main gate. enter the tunnel to the east and lowerniel drakan will appear, along with threevenators. drakan kills mornid and kael is killed by a venator. the myreque retreat back into the castle and veliaf tells the player to find something to barricade the door. vandalise the statue of lord drakan to obtain astatue spearand use it to brace the door. a venator will break in through a nearby window; defeat it and it will jump back out. if you lose this fight, you will respawn in the arboretum with all of your current items. afterwards, climb the stairs. if you have trouble with the fight, stand next to ivan. eat and refill food as needed. veliaf will instruct the player to cover the windows. smash furniture to gainfurniture debrisand use it to barricade the three windows. the furniture gives varying amounts of debris and 3 debris is required to barricade each window. a status bar will countdown the percentage of time that the player has left to barricade the windows. if the status bar depletes with a window remaining uncovered then a venator will break through the window and the player will have to defeat the venator and finish barricading the windows before proceeding. use the blood lock to enter the next room. the player will need to barricade the windows as they pass through a second room; extra debris can be gathered before using the blood lock and can be used in the next room. the second room contains two windows which the player is given less time than before to barricade. use the second blood lock and enter the third room. click on the large table to help the myreque lift it. a venator will break through the window into the room, throwingmekritus a'haraout the broken window. fight the venator until it flees and then help the myreque to finish lifting the table into place. use the third blood lock and enter the next room. barricade the two windows. solve the puzzle to remove the barrier blocking the stairs. the puzzle can be completed by making these moves: players can talk to polmafi if they want to reset the puzzle. after the forcefield has been disabled, climb the stairs. climb the stairs on the western and eastern sides of the chamber and open the blood valves in each room. before entering the eastern room the player will see a cutscene showing safalaan entrusting vanescula withefaritay's pendant. in the western room a venator will appear and wound ivan; this time, veliaf will help you fight the venator, until it flees back through the window. check on ivan, and a little backstory about him will be revealed. return to the centre and then walk north past the ring puzzle to enter the northernmost room. open the final blood valve. climb back down the stairs to the puzzle room; drakan will appear and killradigad ponfit. again clicking on drakan (""talk to.."" option) will terminate the cut-scene and eject the adventurer to the arboretum. polmafi will ask the player to help him solve another puzzle. this can be solved by making the following moves: players can talk to polmafi if they want to reset the puzzle. after the puzzle has been solved, climb the stairs which are surrounding the chamber. everyone discovers that they are on thevampyriumplane's version of the castle, and that the pylons are used to power the portal from vampyrium and gielinor. the player is given 10 mysterious jerky by ivan and must now fight lord drakan while the myreque calibrate pylons around the top of the tower. the fight has multiple stages; after each encounter, life points, prayer points, and your supply of mysterious jerky are all replenished. if the player dies during the fight then they will respawn at the arboretum and can resume the quest by entering the gates of castle drakan - this is a safe death, even forhardcore ironmen. combat boosts, such asoverloadsandprayer renewal, carry over from outside the boss fight. the oo'glogspasulphur springs (15% prayer boost) and thermal baths (3% life points boost) can also be used before the fight. life points stacks with the maximum life point boost frombonfires, giving a maximum boost of 8% at level 98 or 99firemaking. once a stage has been completed successfully, the player will not have to repeat it if they die. it is highly recommended that players read over the following descriptions of the fights before attempting them, to save them unnecessary deaths and wasting of supplies. drakan will summon three venators. the first one will attack you, and the other two will attack the myreque until you attack them. lord drakan himself cannot be attacked in this stage and will fly over the arena and damage the player for 20% of their maximum health if he flies over them. after killing the venators, he will throw a spear at polmafi, but vanescula will protect him and take the spear instead. with his minions out of the way, the player must now fight lord drakan himself, who attacks with melee and has three abilities. when drakan says ""ha ha ha!"" he will throw bombs around him; the player will be damaged for 25% of their maximum life points if they are within a 3x3 area of a bomb when it detonates. drakan moves slowly, allowing you to remain outside melee range, but doing so will trigger his second ability: he will say ""still trying to run?"", ""do you think you can escape?"", ""get over here!"", ""running will not help you."", or ""accept your fate, morsel."", and drag the player towards himself, stunning them and disabling protection/deflect prayers. when this happens, he also inflicts several rapid melee attacks. useanticipationwhen the attack is signalled to avoid the stun, and usefreedomto break free of the stun (you will still be pulled and take damage). staying within melee distance of drakan will prevent the second ability, and consequently the third ability. if you trigger drakan's pull ability a fourth time, it will replace his second ability with a third one. drakan will say ""run all you want..."" while turning the arena dark, then teleport to the player and damage them for 50% of their maximum life points. each time the player lowers drakan's life points by 10,000, he will heal himself for 11% of his current life points; he will heal 4400 at 40,000 life points, 3300 at 30,000, 2200 at 20,000 and 1100 at 10,000. it is recommended that, unless the player can deal high enough damage to sustain themselves withsoul split, to useprotect from meleeordeflect melee. after reducing his life points to 1, drakan is weakened, transforms into a cloud of mist and killsvertida sefalatis. he will then fight the player again, using three new abilities. drakan will not use his healing ability or blood bombs during this phase, but still retains his pull and darkness ability. when drakan says ""fear me!"" he is about to transform again into a cloud of mist. if the cloud touches the player, it will deal 10% of the player's maximum health on the first hit, and then subsequently 15% of the player's maximum health multiple times, while healing drakan for the same amount.while drakan is in this form, you will not be able to deal any damage to him.if you find yourself running out of food on this phase, it is recommended to take advantage of this brief intermission from combat and use a healing ability such asregenerateorguthix's blessingas you run. be sure not to useultimate abilitiesif you plan to do this, in order to preserveadrenaline. you should also add your prayers to youraction barso that you can turn them off while running - this can end up saving a few hundred prayer points by the end of the fight. when drakan says ""embrace darkness!"" he is about to launch a red orb at the player, dealing damage equal to half the player's maximum life points, unless they stand within the dome of lightning that is created by safalaan. standing within the outer edge of the dome will still allow the attack to hit you, so stand close to safalaan. when drakan says ""graaah!"", he will stun the player. there is little time to respond to this warning, soanticipationshould be used regularly throughout the fight and freedom should be used if stunned from it. this can disable protection prayers, but not prayers that boost or drain stats. after the player defeats drakan again, polmafi succeeds in opening the portal. jump in the portal with the rest of the myreque, where they will believe they have finally escaped drakan, who then bursts from the portal, throwingpolmafi ferdygrisback into it in the process. fight drakan again; he will use all abilities from the first and second phases more frequently and more numerous bombs, including healing himself at every 10,000 life point interval. drakan will rarely (if ever) use his red orb attack during this phase. the player will fight alone this time, as their myreque allies are unconscious. close range combat is recommended, running away only on special attacks and when he turns into a cloud. after defeating drakan again, talk to him. vanescula stabs drakan with thesunspearand rips off his wings, weakening him immensely. he breaks off the head of the sunspear and wields it, and now the player will fight him for the final time. this time, he has only 20,000 life points and he will attack rapidly with melee. he uses a special attack where he will stab the player extremely quickly for heavy melee damage, but this can be avoided by moving away from him. his melee attacks will rapidly drain your prayer points. he also throws bombs frequently if you are outside of melee range, though only one is thrown at a time. it is strongly recommended to employ a hit and run tactic usingmagicorranged; a good way to do this is to add your magic or ranged abilities to your action bar, set them to be triggered by your keyboard, and constantly click away from him. as you run, as long as you've attacked him once normally, triggering these abilities will cause you to turn and attack, without requiring you to move the mouse back to click on him, and allowing you to continue to run around the area. if done correctly, this should allow you to avoid the bombs altogether. use the ""finish"" option on lord drakan to initiate a brief conversation in which he states that he regrets nothing and that vanescula will betray the player, and then you will end his life using the remains of the sunspear. the remaining members of the myreque and vanescula will be revived; talk to veliaf. vanescula will declare that she is now the leader of the vampyres. she will then appear to kill safalaan, with plans to use his icyene blood to be able to pass the salve, and then reveal her plans to invademisthalinto restore things to how they were in the days of the zarosian empire. she will then teleport away and the player, veliaf and ivan will return to burgh de rott. once back in burgh de rott veliaf will say that things are hopeless, thatcalsidiudoes not really exist, and disband what little remains of the myreque. talk to ivan, who will ask you to take him to thepaterdomus. choose yes to escort him there. drezel meets the player and ivan, ivan suggests that the player goes to talk toking roald. go tovarrock palaceand inform king roald of what has happened in morytania. several cutscenes will occur: drezel, who has learned of the events from ivan, stating that the barrier must be reinforced; veliaf embedding his sickle in the myreque plaque and leaving; vanescula standing in front of and mocking the deceased drakan. meanwhile, the mysterious prisoner escapes from drakan's dungeon in vampyrium after sensing his death. the lord of vampyrium is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: following the release ofthe branches of darkmeyer, mod ana would continue shaping the plot of the remainder of the myreque series and stated she was very excited to be working on it in addition to her main projects. the release ofthe world wakesin march2013meant she had to adjust parts of her design, seeing that that quest's events had changed the role of themorytanian splinter grouplast seen inlegacy of seergaze.[3] the curator of the myreque series,mod ana, was not a developer of the quest due to her being in the ninja team at the time of the poll, and no longer working onrunescapeat the time of release. however, the greater part of the design was hers, andmod rowley, was supposed to be working in close cooperation with her. ana would have been able to write some of the dialogue as well, but due to her leaving jagex, this most likely changed.[4][5] atrunefest 2013, the myreque series was discussed by mod ana. she mentioned that the next quest would focus onsafalaan, that she would like to revealvanstrom's history and that the series might potentially feature spin-off quests about the splinter group and the werewolves.[6] in2014,mod osborneconfirmed the quest would not be released that year due to the development of a very large amount of elf content, consisting ofplague's end- the finale to theelf quest series-,prifddinasand thetirannwn achievement diary.[source needed]in the latter half of december, a dragonstonepower to the playerspoll was released, allowing players to vote between the next myreque quest and a daemonheim quest for release at the end of 2015. the poll came with a detailed description of the quest: of course, you will not go unprepared. the quest will see you discover safalaan's true potential, using it along with vanescula's help to ready yourself for the final face-off. you will once again work with the individuals of the myreque, uncovering ivan strom's role in this tale and revealing unexpected truths about other members. when you are ready for battle, you will infiltrate drakan's castle in the heart of darkmeyer, once again using your vampyre disguise to pass undetected towards its gates. however, once you are inside those foreboding walls, who knows what troubles await you. will your disguise really fool drakan himself? the sixth myreque quest promises uncovered secrets, shocking twists and arduous battle. will you return to morytania to destroy the vampyres once and for all? castle drakan will be yours to explore freely after the quest, and it will unlock combat and skill updates, as well as give you more opportunities to act like a vampyre. the myreque quest subsequently won.[2]later, it was announced on the forums and ontwitterthatmod rowleywould most likely be developing the quest after finishing work ondimension of disasterand possibly theconstructionupdate. by the end of january, the quest had entered pre-design stage as mod ana drew up her aims and plans for it.[7]the quest entered development stage in the first half of march.[8] according to the developer, mod ana's departure from therunescapeteam in april had no impact on the development of the quest.[9]around late june, mod stu joined the development team whenadamantandrune dragonswere released.[10] in late june, the ninja team also started a myreque series spotlight, aiming to make improvements to the existing myreque quests and their rewards.[11]closer to release, a medley of the newmusic trackswas also released.[12] in august, the members of the myreque, minusveliafandsafalaan, who had been updated four years prior, were graphically updated.[13]these graphical updates, along with the addition ofskyboxesto morytania, were released on10 august2015. in addition, dialogue forthe branches of darkmeyerwas added toameliaandrory.[14] over the course of the following days, villagers began disappearing fromburgh de rott, with one villager disappearing every day that a player withthe branches of darkmeyercompleted visited the village, specific to each player. every time a villager disappeared, a missing poster appeared for them and amelia and rory's dialogue about the branches of darkmeyer updated to note their disappearance. a total of 20 villagers disappeared, leaving only amelia, rory, aurel, cornelius, elisabeta and radu. after 7 disappearances,veliaf hurtzalso gained new dialogue, speaking about the people who have been disappearing from burgh de rott and that there are rumours that lord lowerniel drakan is poised to make his return."

in the castle's basement. the goblins turn out to be the pacifistdorgeshuuntribe which has been lost from history for many years. when part of the cellar wall collapses, the duke insists the damage was caused by an earthquake, but sigmund is worried about a monster attack. if you investigate this mystery, it will lead you through treacherous caves to uncover something lost by the gods for thousands of years. to start off, talk tosigmund, who can be found on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]oflumbridge castle, in theduke'sroom. ask him if he has any quests for you, and he tells you that the lumbridge cellar has, presently, a hole in one of its walls and that you should ask the people around for more information about its source. you must speak to the following people until one of them tells you that they saw a goblin with huge eyes in the castle basement: report this tosigmundand then to the duke. he'll then give you the permission to investigate this matter. if you have completed the questdragon slayer, sigmund will tell the duke that you slewelvargto help persuade him to let you investigate the cellar. skills required:17miningto unblock the tunnel, and 13agilityto squeeze through. go down the ladder in the kitchen and look for a blocked tunnel (namedrubble) and mine it. make sure that yourlight sourceis illuminated, then squeeze through the tunnel. walk a bit further inside and grab thebroochlying on the floor near an intersection in the tunnel (look for the red dot). you can also take the path southwest from the brooch spawn and mine out the hole there, for easier access to thelumbridge swamp caves. do not enter the swamp caves for now though, as there arewall beastsandexplosive gases, which can cause a lot of damage to the unprepared. also watch out not to enter any other paths within this cave, as there are many traps. some traps can send you to the swamp caves, another reason to mine out the hole so you can get back easily. make your way back, and don't look around, otherwise you may fall into a pit. show the brooch to the duke and sigmund. they will tell you to go to the librarian in varrock. travel tovarrockcastle, and show it toreldo, the librarian. he'll tell you to search the bookcases for a book ongoblin history. search the north-western bookcase to obtain the book. make sure you go through the dialogue, or you will not obtain the book, and if you try to search again you will only receive the unrelatedwilderness manual, which must be destroyed before you search the bookcase again to get the right book. read the whole book to see that the symbol on the brooch translates to ""dorgeshuun, goblins of the strong spears"". keep the book for the remainder of the quest, since it is very important. to get to know more about the dorgeshuun, you need to talk togeneral bentnozeandgeneral wartfaceingoblin village. choose the options in the following order: they'll argue about minor things just like they did ingoblin diplomacy, but eventually tell you more about the dorgeshuun, saying that they disappeared during thegod warsand have not been seen since. the generals will also teach you thegoblin saluteandgoblin bowemotes. if you haven't donegoblin diplomacyyet, the conversation changes, and you are prompted to finish that quest before continuing on. go back to lumbridge and talk to the duke. he will tell you to further investigate the caves for more clues. go back into the tunnel. go to the junction and you will find a 'symbol' on the rock. read it and if for example, it says ""goblins of the east"", go east. repeat this at all of the junctions: read the symbols on the rocks, translate them with the goblin history book and follow the instructions. do not try taking any shortcuts in this part. if you do not follow the path instructed by the rocks, one of two things will happen: it is easier to change the display options to ""minimum"" as the caves will be easier to see, and thus lowering the chances of getting lost. when you reach the end, you'll find the dorgeshuun tribe. do your goblin bow in front ofmistag. he will tell you that the dorgeshuun are actually peaceful and the lumbridge kitchen scare was an accident. you'll also learn about thegoblins' backstory. follow mistag and he will take you back to lumbridge. when you tell the duke about the dorgeshuun and their offering for peace, he won't believe you because somesilverwarehad recently been stolen from the castle basement and he surmises the goblins to be the culprits. pickpocket sigmund to get akeyand unlock the chest located in the next room to find someh.a.m. robes; keep these, as you'll need it for the sequel quest. speak with the duke before you leave and he will tell you that he is going to keep an eye on sigmund. enter theh.a.m. dungeonthrough theold mine entrance, located north-east of lumbridge castle and just across the farther bridge over the river, and search the crate near the entrance to find the stolen silverware. if you did not open sigmund's chest, this crate will be empty. go back to the duke with the silverware in your inventory, and tell him you found it in the h.a.m hideout. petrified by hearing this, the duke will fire and oust sigmund for his crime of framing the goblins and will give you a signedpeace treatyand tell you to get the leader of the dorgeshuun tribe to sign it as well. go back underground to mistag. this time, you won't have to navigate through yourself because you'll see a new goblin namedkazgar. he will guide you through the mines, like mistag earlier. crossing the mine, talk to mistag. he'll agree to escort the goblin leader,ur-tagto the lumbridge castle dining room, with you and mistag as witnesses of the treaty. in the middle of the signing cutscene, you will find out that sigmund, clad in full h.a.m. outfit is eavesdropping outside the castle door, but you cannot stop him from laughing cunningly and sliding away.  the lost tribe is directly required

he will tell you to meet him outside, and then he will follow you torimmington. talk to him outside his house and agree to go. he will follow you as you walk, and will also follow you if you use the lodestone teleport to draynor village, cabbageport or a skill necklace to thecrafting guild. however, if you go too far off course, he will return to his house. talking to people like theguard in treeresults in humorous conversations. go to rimmington, specifically the house portal, and talk to dionysius. make sure he is in position and not following you or you will not be able to enter the house. he will attempt to get into his old house but will not be able to because zenevivia has removed it from theteleportation matrixso that it cannot be entered (otherwise you two could enter in building mode and delete everything). he will tell you to meet him in the house ofhengelandanja, ""friends"" of his. he will also tell you to bring a chisel. even if you have one already, he will go to the house (resulting in a humorous thought). go to hengel's house just east of the portal and talk to dionysius. ask him what to do and he will explain the technique of chipping teleport tablets to reach the magic inside and modify the teleportation location. he will give you 100tabsand you will use the chisel on one of them to chip it. dionysius will then tell you to open the tablet. do so, and a puzzle will appear. there are two tablet halves; start with the bottom one. drag the connections from the left onto the tiles in order to lead the magic from the yellow dot at the bottom of the half to a point at the top. you can remove a tile by using its right-click menu. black squares, which are dead zones, have been harmed by chipping and can no longer conduct magic. the same goes for the upper half, which is a bit tougher. the screen will close when the solution is correct. bottom of the puzzle top of the puzzle if you leave the house at any time, you must re-chip another house tablet and break it near dionysius inhengel's house. in addition bring two combat styles. stand next to the wise old man and break the chipped teleportation tablet. you will be teleported to zenevivia's house, which she's completely renovated. the house is not safe. if you die, your gravestone will appear inrimmington, outside the house portal, and you will arrive at yourrespawn point. a quick way to get back is to use the port sarim lodestone and run west. he will comment that she has redecorated, and that you have to go through the dungeon to reach her. go east to the dungeon and tell him to go first. a short cutscene will show him getting injured by a trap. he will tell you to bring a steel and mithril bar and two oak planks. if you had them already, another humorous conversation will take place. use the steel bar on the clockmaker's bench in the workshop, just north of the entrance, to make aclockwork, then talk to dionysius about what to do next. he will suggest you make adummyto confuse and disable all the traps. sit behind the bench and make a dummy, then put it in the dungeon. the controls are easy; it's just like normal walking. during this part, there will be a pulsating purple light around your screen, as seen on the picture. any players sensitive to flashing lights should proceed with caution. an update on 19 july added an interface to reduce the light's frequency. if you suffer from vertigo, you can still be affected and breaks may be needed. remember: deactivate all the traps by walking on them and then return to the surface. you can attempt to use the stairs in the last room, which will cause the wise old man to offer to return the dummy immediately. alternatively, you can choose to walk it back through the rooms yourself and back up the first set of stairs. you can now safely enter the dungeon and fight your way to zenevivia. enter the dungeon and enter the first room. the monsters are not aggressive, but will begin fighting after dionysius has attacked them, which he does almost immediately. he can hit high in the 100s, not only on the lower-levelled monsters but also on the dragon. now enter the final door and talk to dionysius, who will want to make up with zenevivia. if you are ready to fight, go upstairs. after talking to zenevivia, you can teleport out to prepare for the last fight. you won't have to fight the monsters again. talk tozenevivia- dionysius will try to talk to her, but she is too angry with him and starts the battle. necromancy makes it so you don't need to swtich styles at all and kills her fastest since she can't protect against it. melee is recommended for the statue phase, while ranged or mage can be used for the more mobile ground phase. firstly, she will attack both you and dionysius withblood barrage, which can hit high and heal her, so useprotect from magicat all times. secondly, she makes flames appear on the square the player is standing on, so moving around will help avoid being damaged by them. she will summon flames every few seconds and they will very rapidly hit 300-400 life points every game tick, which cannot be blocked. eat when necessary and continue attacking her. when she yells ""aha!"" she will enter another phase of the fight. she will first create a fire around her, destroy one of the statues, and teleport onto it. at this point, she will useprotect from missilesif attacked with range andprotect from magicif attacked using spells; however both prayers appear to block most non-melee attacks from the player. dionysius can still damage her, although his damage is not as reliable. during this phase, she will also cease to attack but will still summon flames about every second. the easiest way to end this phase is to use a knockback attack such askickwith a melee weapon, but otherwise the flames can be dodged by simply running around the room while getting in occasional damage, and when she's lost enough health, she will teleport back to the ground. on the ground she can be attacked again until she goes to another statue plinth, which happens about four times. after the last statue, she will still attack with blood barrage; her flames will become less frequent (one every ~6 seconds) but will cover a larger area, about 6x6 squares. run from one side of the room to another while shooting arrows at her. when she is defeated, she will be on the ground in front of the throne and you can talk to her. after you have defeated her, dionysius will tell her about thedraynor bank robberyand that he is a self-centred battle-mage like her, and she will confess also having missed him and they forgive each other. there will be a cutscene and you will return to draynor village. ask zenevivia about mabel's ring. she will inform you that she and dionysius will plan to rob thewizards' towerto replenish their depleted supplies, and they tell you to watch from the telescope. she will also not give you the partyhat dionysius gave her as ""borrowed items cannot be traded"". go upstairs and look through the telescope and watch thewizards' tower robbery. after defeating all the wizards, they are attacked by a giant familiarthingummywut, summoned by the seemingly incompetenttraiborn. players cannot see it, but they can see the incredibly rapidearth surgesit uses to attack. upon their return, ask about the robbery and then for mabel's ring, and your rewards will be given and explained to you. congratulations, quest complete! unlocking the rewards below is amaster quest caperequirement: love story is not currently required for any quests or miniquests."

(he is downstairs at the stern or rear of the ship, in front of bunks, middle deck) he tells you a bit about the pirates' visit to the moon clan. go up three levels to the stern of the ship, and ask'lecherous' leeabout the big feast. he says he saw the first mate slip away for a bit. confrontfirst mate 'davey-boy'(who is on the same deck ascaptain bentley, in the room at the stern of the ship). he is, however, able to explain his absence but mentions that he couldn't find thecabin boyat the feast. finally, talk with the cabin boy. he is on the same deck as 'lecherous' lee. he confesses that a girl from the moon clan tricked him into drawing five symbols throughout the ship. the cabin boy gives you a special lantern and lens that you can use to search the ship for the symbols. use theemerald lenson thebullseye lantern frameto create a mysticalemerald lantern. then light the lantern by selecting 'light'. the cabin boy also gives you five clues for finding the symbols: talk tocaptain bentleyagain, and set sail for lunar isle!  climb down from the raised dock, and head north-west into thecity. acutsceneof a bird's-eye vision of the city plays upon your initial walking through the city gates. talk withmeteora, in the south-west part of the village. she tells you that although the clan doesn't have a leader, theoneiromanceris able to help you more than anyone. go to the south-east part of the island, to theastral altar, and talk to the oneiromancer (watch out for the suqahs). she tells you more about the moon clan's feud with thefremennik. she also asks that you try to understand the moon clan's ways. to do so, you need to go through their ritual. to prepare for the ritual, you need to make three things: awaking sleep potion, alunar staff, andceremonial travelling clothes. talk tobaba yagain thechicken-leg housein the north of the village. during your talk, she gives you aspecial vialand says you needclean guam,clean marrentill, and someground suqah toothto complete the potion. before going to killsuqahs, make sure to fill up the vial with water in the sink in baba yaga's house. you can also fill your vial in the house west of the bank. kill suqahs until one drops asuqah tooth(you could collect 4 suqah hides that are needed in later stages, but later in the quest you need to bash some more, and then they can also drop the tiara that you need, so it might be better to wait). if you don't have marrentill and guam, suqahs also frequently drop them. the suqahs on the northern half of the island can use spells similar towater waveandice barrage, making it impossible to safe-spot them. the suqahs on the southern half of the island do not have this ability. add your marrentill and guam to baba yaga's vial (after filling it with water at a sink in the town) to obtain aguam-marr vial. if you accidentally grind the guam, then the ground guam works as well. grind the tooth with yourpestle and mortarand add it in to make awaking sleep vial, and take it back to theoneiromancer. make sure you give oneiromancer the potion before taking the staff to the altars; otherwise, nothing will happen and you will have to go back and give oneiromancer the potion anyway. grab yourdramen staff(or staves), and use it on each of the four elemental altars in this order: you may want to bring dramen staves to make multiplelunar staves, as you lose the ability to create multiple staves by yourself once you give your staff to theoneiromancer(and backups or a bank placeholder may be useful). you can use any method to reach the altars, such as thewicked hood, travel via the surface world with the appropriatetalismansortiaras, or trips to theabyss. your dramen staff is now a lunar staff. return tolunar isle, talk with the oneiromancer, who takes your new lunar staff. thesuitto enter the land of dreams is composed of eight items:helm,torso,legs,gloves,boots,cape,amulet, andring. talk to the oneiromancer about how to obtain each of the eight items. they can be obtained in any order. with anypickaxe, head north-east on the isle to find thelunar isle mine, marked with a dungeon symbol on the minimap. enter the mine through the small shack, and mine one of the grey stalagmites in the western part of the mine (next to the walls) to get alunar ore. refine the ore by smelting it at anyfurnace(there is one in western rellekka; forges do not work, neither does superheat item), then smith the resultinglunar barinto alunar helmon ananvil. travel back to lunar isle, and talk withpauline polaris, in a house in the north-west corner of the village. she wants you to guess her real name before she gives you the lunar cape: after you have guessed correctly, she gives you thelunar cape. talk to meteora (she is in the south-west part of the village, by the house next to the l-shaped room with the water icon). she asks you to retrieve the tiara she lost to thesuqahs. kill suqahs until one dropsa special tiara(collect foursuqah hidesnow if you haven't already, as you need them in the next step), and then go back to meteora and trade her tiara for thelunar amulet. speak withrimae sirsalis, who runs themoon clan fine clothesshop, across from the bank about ceremonial clothes. speak to her again about ceremonial clothes and she will offer to tan the suqah hides for you. she can tan suqah hides for 100 gp each. have her tan the foursuqah hidesyou got earlier. buy a needle and a spool of thread (if you don't have them), and make thelunar torso,legs,gloves, andboots. if you attempt to make a second set of lunar torso/legs/gloves/boots, you will receive the message, ""you already have the ... part of the ceremonial clothes."" this occurs whether the first set is in your inventory or your bank, or in the magic chest in your player-owned house, and it is not possible to drop the clothes without destroying them. talk withselene, near the centre of the village (in or around one of the buildings near the lockedlunar isle lodestone). she gives you a clue to finding a ring. grab a spade, and go out the eastern gate of the village. travel south-east until you reach a bridge. cross it, then cross the bridge to the west right next to it. keep heading west until you see a patch of blue flowers near a starfish. dig on top of the flowers to obtain thelunar ring. do not have a clue scroll in your inventory requiring you to dig while obtaining the ring. with all the lunar items you just made and found, go back to talk with theoneiromancer. (make sure you have 11 empty spots.) she first takes everything from you for safekeeping and then gives you back all your ceremonial clothes, lunar staff, and potion, plus somemagic kindlingfor the ceremony. if you logout or die during this portion and lose some or all of the equipment required for the ritual, the oneiromancer will have a replacement. make sure you still have your seal of passage in either your inventory or your neck slot.   put on your ceremonial clothes, wield the lunar staff, and dismiss your follower. go to the big building at the far west end of the village that has theceremonial brazierin it (the building is just south ofpauline polaris.) make sure you are wearing all of thelunar equipmentand wielding the staff, or else you will have to visit theoneiromancerto replace the waking sleep potion and kindling. use thewaking sleep vialon the kindling, light the brazier with atinderbox, and place thesoaked kindlingin the brazier. welcome to the land of your own dreams. talk to theethereal manorethereal lady, according to your character's gender. they explain you are about to take a test by completing a series of tasks or puzzles. (you do six lessons and then a final challenge with yourself.) if you fail any of the tasks, you can try again. after completing each task, talk to the ethereal person in the centre. you can do the tasks in any order. if you need to leave, click the ""my life"" book on the lectern in the centre to go back to your reality world. if you log out or otherwise leave dreamland while doing this part of the quest, you'll have to speak to theoneiromancerto reobtain thewaking sleep vialand themagic kindling. however, your progress will not be lost. if you have an extra set oflunar equipmentstored in yourplayer-owned house, you will have to retrieve it before talking to the oneiromancer, or the dialogue will loop. to get to this task, step on the platform located at the 7 o'clock position (south-south-west), if you have the map oriented north (the platform is avocado green, the same colour as anagility potion, if you brought one). speak with theethereal fluke, who explains how to play the game. the fluke shouts out a number. flip over the six dice so the sum of the numbers facing up on the dice equals the fluke's number. so, for example, if the fluke shouts out ""15,"" you could roll over the six dice to show 6 + 4 + 2 +1 + 1 + 1 to equal 15. each die has just two possibilities, however: the number facing up, and the number on its opposite side. so depending on what is facing up, any one die can show: remember the pattern well, the +1/-1 means that flipping the given die will have that effect. once you have the correct number of dots on all the dice, the ethereal fluke shouts out the next number. he gives you five numbers in this task. an easy way to do this is to set all the dice to their lowest values and calculate the increase needed. after you have completed it, talk with the ethereal person again to tell them what you learned. to get to this task, step on the platform located at the 4 o'clock position (east-south-east), if you have the map oriented north (the platform is lavender). speak with theethereal numerator, who explains how to complete this task. he speaks with a mixture of numbers and words, so making out his meaning can be challenging. if you skip over the numbers in his conversation, however, and just read the words, you can understand him. the ethereal numerator tells you a sequence of numbers. look for the pattern in the sequence, and then press the two numbers that would come next in the pattern. you can ask the ethereal numerator for the sequence again if you forget. if you are wrong, the ethereal numerator just gives you another sequence of numbers to work on. here are sequences the ethereal numerator may possibly give you, with the next two numbers in the patterns highlighted: after you have solved five patterns, talk with the ethereal person again to tell them what you learned. to get to this task, step on the platform located at the 1 o'clock position (north-north-east), if you have the map oriented north (the platform is slate blue). speak with theethereal perceptive, who explains this test. this can be a fairly easy task: the ethereal perceptive challenges you to a log-cutting race. the first one to pile 20dream logsin the centre wins. the ethereal perceptive deposits two logs at a time and walks. to beat him, turn on run, cut all four of yourdream trees(if the bronze hatchet he gives you leaves you with less than 4 slots, you can drop it and use the hatchet on your tool belt), and deposit them in the centre. if you can hover your cursor to find that pile, you must use it or you will get no credit for the logs you drop. go back and forth 5 times to make a total of 20. it is possible, but unnecessary, to distract him while he's cutting some logs by talking to him. to help you keep track, you should receive messages telling you how many logs you and the ethereal perceptive have each deposited. if you only receive messages about his logs, you are not being credited for yours; find the correct spot to drop the logs. after you have completed this task, talk with the ethereal person again to tell them what you learned. to get to this task, step on the platform located at the 10 o'clock position (west-north-west), if you have the map oriented north (the platform is ash grey, a bit darker than the surrounding area). speak with theethereal guide, who explains this task. similar to the pit and the grid part of theunderground pass, jump from one floating dream puff to another to reach the other side, hoping not to land on a not-real dream puff that gives way under you and send you back to the platform. if you fail, you do not receive any damage. you can't move diagonally but can jump north, east, south, and west. you shouldn't have to backtrack to reach the other side. you can use table below to track your path: click cell to highlight it, click again to cancel highlight. after you have completed this task, speak with the ethereal person again to tell them what you learned. to get to this challenge, step on the platform located at the 3 o'clock position (east), if you have the map oriented north (the platform is tea green). speak with theethereal expert, who challenges you to a race. he bets he can beat you to the other side of the island. he takes the left andstraightroute. you take the right andcurvyroute—with four hurdles. despite the ethereal expert's advantage, this isn't as one-sided as it looks. the ethereal expert walks a few steps, pauses, takes a few more steps, pauses, and so on to the finish. it's possible to barely win if you fail 2 times, but if you fail 3 or more times it's best to wait and lose to save food. if you brought asummer pieor agilityboost, or havesurefooted aura, activate the agility effect before the race begins. turn on run. even at 99 agility, it is still possible to fail the obstacles. jump over the four hurdles, and eat when necessary. after you have won the race, speak with the ethereal person again to tell them what you learned. to get to this task, step on the platform located at the 5 o'clock position (south-south-east), if you have the map oriented north (the platform is blue-green). speak with theethereal mimic, on the musical-note island, who explains how to complete this task. the ethereal mimic performs an emote that you then copy, much like you do in thefollow the leaderpuzzle indungeoneering. the ethereal mimic uses only thebasic emotesthat every player has. talk to the ethereal mimic again if you forgot the emote he asked you to perform. after each emote, the ethereal mimic teleports to a different part of the island, so speak to him after each emote. be warned the mimic may stand on the blue-green platform; a misclick will send you back and force you to repeat the puzzle from the beginning. after you have successfully copied the ethereal mimic five times, talk with the ethereal person again to tell them what you learned. once you have completed all the tasks, speak with the ethereal person in the centre of the island. they talk about the six core lessons you just learned and say there is one more challenge you must face. be sure to stock up on runes forfire spells, me's weakness. tell them you are ready. you are teleported to another island with two dream trees and five floating beams that look like rays of light. you also seeme, a 84-level version of yourself wearing lighter-colouredlunar equipment. as you fight me, both you and me teleport around the platform every 15 seconds or so. turning auto-retaliate on while fighting means you can easily run back to me after you both teleport. it is possible to get ""me"" to walk in to the center island, and then walk to the tree on the outside ring to safe shoot him. attack me using spells with your lunar staff equipped. since it is not possible to melee with a staff, me must be killed with magic. it is worth mentioning that you cannot kill me with your own weapons, as the game prevents your from removing the staff. if you do not have any runes with you, it is safe to log out and log back in and grab another potion from oneiromancer along with some combat runes;

anenchanted key- that you may use to learn about the outpost's history. the enchanted key reacts to a buried chest, and the closer to the chest you are, the warmer the key. the key's states go from frozen, to cold, to warm, to very hot, to burning hot, and finally to steaming hot when standing directly on top of the chest. the chest is located between theobservatoryand thecastle warslobby, directly south of the observatory and before the bridge. you must dig it up using either a spade or meerkats. use the enchanted key to unlock thechest, which contains ajournalabout a zamorakian nameddrozal, who took up residence in the outpost with 8 other followers and created trouble for the people ofardougne. additional treasure from the enchanted key can only be obtained after the quest has been completed. droalak, according to jorral, died at the outpost and might be able to provide valuable information about the outpost. he can be found wandering near theport phasmatysgeneral store in the south-west part of the city. equip your ghostspeak amulet, enter port phasmatys and speak to droalak. droalak tells you that he holds a scroll describing the timelines of the outpost, but he first wants your help in reconciling his wife,melina. he had gone against his wife's wishes, and left to go to the outpost, and she refuses to forgive him for not returning to her. in order to earn her forgiveness, he requests you to present her with astrung sapphire amulet, as that was the last gift he had given her. melina, also dead and now a ghost, can be found in the building just east of the general store. she is elated by droalak's gift and agrees to forgive him, before passing on from the world. go back and deliver the message to droalak, who hands over thescrollas a token of gratitude, and requests to inform him if the scroll was of any use. dronisn't directly related to the outpost, but jorral figures that it might be fruitful to talk to him since he has studied about various wars, and the outpost must be bound to have been involved in one of them. dron can be found inrellekka, north-east of the market and near themusician. he has no time for ""weaklings"" though, and says to speak to his brother,blanin. blanin is in the south-eastern part of the town, just north of the house with the dairy churn. he tells you that his brother is an introvert and only speaks to those who know him well enough. since you have a noble intention, he provides you with information about dron - on the condition that he must not know that you spoke with his brother. go to dron and tell him that you're after someimportant answers. when he asks how you know him, respond that it is because he is ""the famous warrior dron."" he is suspicious and creates a test to figure out how much you really know about him. the order and wording of his questions may vary for each player, but the correct answers are: when satisfied, he reminisces reading about a battle between a couple old friends, who were separated on their beliefs; one followed zamorak, while the other favoured saradomin. the battle culminated with both of them clashing swords atop the outpost, where they eventually woke up to the gravity of the situation and realised the error of their ways. shortly after, they re-united and converted to guthix followers. bring back all the information to jorral, who will be ecstatic about the discoveries and promptly proceed to summarise them into aletterto be delivered to king lathas, providing him with the suggestion of converting the outpost into a museum instead. king lathascan be found in his bedroom on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]of the east ardougne castle. he is surprised to learn about the outpost's rich history and writes areply letter, in which he promises to build the outpost into a museum. the letter must then be delivered to jorral, who will be glad that the outpost has been saved. congratulations, quest complete! making history is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

to meetzarador,bork,dad,general graardor,general wartfaceandgeneral bentnoze. talk with one of them and go through all the options. the leaders will argue about who should be the new leader, and the player will suggest a candidate. the leaders do not agree and instead will suggest an ancient way to elect the leader: thekyzaj tournament. although zarador sees right through the tournament idea as a plot to delay their attack, he allows zanik to represent thedorgeshuun. the player declares that they will fight on zanik's behalf instead, but only as her 'trained attack beast' according to bork, which you will have no choice but to accept. go back to dorgesh-kaan and talk to zanik, who is still with ur-tag. she will tell you that a portal has opened where the bandosian tower once stood. head to the remnants of the bandosian camp near thegoblin village. if you have one, you could use agoblin village sphereteleport you near the tower. otherwise, it's just as easy to use thefaladorlodestoneand walk north toward the goblin village. at the fork in the road just south of goblin village, take the eastern path up the hill, and you'll pass by the dramatic, petrified remains of the big high war god, bandos. standing in front of his remains is a hooded zanik. speak with her to learn that it was bandos who resurrected her (as his 'chosen commander') using part of himself, thus she shares some of bandos' memory. she has grown weaker since bandos was killed in the secondworld event, and feels that she will die soon. she still hopes that you can win the tournament so that she can lead the bandosian army somewhere else and save the dorgeshuun. now, enter the portal to travel toyu'biusk. thegoblin maitre d'will speak briefly with you, telling you thatzaradoris up and around the spiral pathway (see map). follow the path up the mountain, climb a ladder, walk around bandos' throne, and talk tozarador, who will explain the rules of the tournament. there is a bank chest next to zarador in case you need it. head to 'your camp' (travel west, descend 2 ladders; see map) and talk to your supporters;burntmeat,my arm, andgrubfoot. eventually a goblin messenger will arrive and announce the details of your first fight(continue the chat dialogue, don't try to talk to him directly). he reveals that your first opponent isyelps, champion of the goblins. as he speaks, you start noticing correct grammar, complex sentences, and other non-goblin speech that makes you and your friends suspicious. just before he leaves, he spills the beans by calling zarador a fool! he then drops the charade to reveal that he is ahuman infiltrator! he attacks, but is not very strong and should be easy to dispatch(again, just continue with chat dialogue; do not interact with anyone or anything, or you'll be forced to start from the beginning). after you defeat him, you and your supporters will notice a note on his body, revealing an infiltration plan led by a group of banished human bandosians. their plan is to win the tournament by poisoning the competitors. note:if any problems arise regarding game play during this portion of the quest, you can try: go to zarador to warn him of the plot. he'll demand that you find and kill the 5 remaining human infiltrators by yourself, ending with""try not to kill too many real goblins while you're at it"". talk to the goblins in every area; you'll need to go through the first two dialogue options with each one you talk with, and if you think he's a human, accuse him of being so. if you guess incorrectly you'll instantly kill him, but guess correctly and he will shed his disguise and attack you. the human infiltrators have combat levels ranging from 98 to 112. there is no penalty for actually killing every real goblin, but there is extra dialogue with zarador if you do. either way, there are five (5) normal goblins and five (5) infiltrators for a total of 10 goblins that can be killed. note:you are unable to use certaineocabilitieswhile at yu'biusk, so you may consider disablingrevolutionif you have it enabled. the human infiltrator-goblins that you are searching for are as follows(see map above): once you've discovered and dealt with all of the infiltrators, return to zarador and report. when all of the humans are slain you must return to zarador. he will be ungracious, still blaming you for the human infiltrators. return to your camp and prepare for the fight, you can bank any forbidden items at the bank chest beside zarador. zarador will explain the rules of the tournament, specifically, that each round includes a special rule that you must follow. for the first round, you'll be allowed to take in goblin back-up. of course, you have none, so you are at a distinct disadvantage. you have the option to begin the tournament from this point, or go hold off to prepare. when you are ready, just speak with zarador again. summoning familiars are not allowed in the kyzaj tournament. recommended items:full inventory of the best food you can get, such assharksorrocktails.super restore potionsto recharge yourdefenceandprayerlevels as they are drained.saradomin brewsare not recommended.emergency teleportoptions can be used to avoid death. note:if you use therevolutioncombat mode, it is highly advised to disable it while at yu'biusk, as someabilitiesare unavailable, and will therefore cause your player to pause during fighting, essentially rendering you a sitting duck to opponents. your first fight will be againstyelps, thegoblinchampion, and former host of thesqueal of fortune. per this round's special rules, yelps will have goblinbodyguardsaiding him in battle. yourdefencerating will be reduced by fifteen (15) until you've killed the first set of bodyguards. the first set of bodyguards will have 20,000 lifepoints, and subsequent bodyguards will have 10,000. while they are active, yelps will take only minimal damage from you, so you'll need to defeat them before attacking him. however, when the bodyguards have been defeated, you'll be able to consistently damage yelps with hits of 10,000 (12,000 for critical strikes). he has 200,000 life points, so it will be important to take advantage of these special tournament mechanics to deal damage to him. periodically, yelps will engage in a (quite annoying) special attack, in which he squeals, ""wooohooo, extra spin for the win!"", while spinning around and dealing bursts of damage to you if you're within his range. he teleports five times during this lengthy special attack, throwing coins at his next teleport location (this gives you a moment to run away if he's about to teleport near you). the trick for this battle is to stick to the edge of the fighting platform, thus avoiding as much damage from his special attacks as possible. while he's not using his special attack, he can sometimes be blocked using his bodyguards. take them out as quickly as possible, and when they're gone, unleash all that you have on him. tactics that take advantage of increased damage are very beneficial in this fight, includingsoul splitand thespecial attackof thesaradomin godsword, which will heal much more than they originally do. if soul split cannot be used, thenprotect from meleeordeflect meleeare recommended to halve all non-ability damage from both yelps and bodyguards. you may use anemergency teleportoption such as theectophialorluck of the dwarvesto avoid death, and therefore have safe practise runs to get a feel for things. surprisingly, this won't affect the quest, and you'll be able to restart the round by speaking to zarador, as if nothing had happened. after defeating yelps, you can choose to kill or spare him. if he's spared he'll give you anexpired spin ticket, and acoin pouchcontaining 73,105 coins. if you choose to kill him, these rewards will be available from yelps's chest, in the goblin camp. you'll next appear back in front of zarador, who will be surprised at your victory. you will then speak to zanik back in goblin village. note:it is advised to replenish your health and prayer points before the next round of the tournament. you may use the cooking pot in your camp (health) and bandos' remains (prayer), next to zanik. once you've spoken with zanik, ensure you've replenished your prayer points, health, and other levels, and return to zarador. zarador will inform you that your next fight is againstlol, thetrollchampion, the brother ofmorningstarand the uncle ofbaby troll. suggested items:stat-boosting potions such asoverloads,extreme potions, orsuper potions,prayer potions,enhanced excalibur(or another good weapon), and lots of good food.during the fight, lol will be protected from ranged and magic, so the use of melee is suggested. forbidden items:you cannot wear armour, including auras, pocket items, and jewellery. additionally, theancient elven ritual shardand non-combat items including theectophial,crystal teleport seed, etc. are also forbidden(although teleport runes are still allowed). to check which items you cannot bring in, talk to grubfoot in your camp, and he will tell you of all the disallowed items you have equipped or in your inventory, or just try to start the battle. when you are ready, speak with zarador again to enter the fight. lol will remain stationary in the middle of the arena for the duration of this fight. every few seconds, he yells ""me smash you wif big rock""(a dialogue also appears above your character, warning you to move). when this happens, you should quickly move out of the way, and continue attacking him. if the rocks hit you directly, you'll take around 1400-1700 points of damage. an additional challenge in this round is introduced as the rocks that lol throws remain on the field. every 4-5 of his rock throws will trigger the existing rocks to explode, dealing heavy damage if you're too close to them. regardless of your proximity to the explosions, you'll still take at least 860 points of damage when they explode. note:you are able to destroy the rocks while they're on the ground, but you'll take some damage in the process. doing this doesn't really benefit you, unless you have no other safe places to avoid the big blasts. useprotect from/deflectmissiles, as lol's main attack uses ranged. on paper, this round isn't particularly difficult; it's more of an endurance round than anything. you'll take a lot of damage during the fight, but if you keep your health up, it's manageable. the main trick is to continuously deal damage to lol, while avoiding his large rocks and their periodic explosions. the best strategy is to attack lol until he yells about throwing his big rock. when he does, just run a few paces clockwise (or anticlockwise) around him, and continue attacking him. when the rocks on the ground begin flashing orange, retreat to the edge of the arena until they explode. you'll take some damage each time, but it'll be much less than a direct hit. repeat the process until you emerge victorious. note:some players may prefer to use a halberd, as it gives them extra space from the exploding rocks. lol is stationary throughout the fight. this also meansslaughteris not recommended for this fight since lol takes no extra damage and this ability takes time to activate. once you've defeated lol, choose either to kill or spare him, and then return to zarador. speak with zarador, and he will reveal that he is impressed with you, and that you've reminded him that being bandosian isn't merely about the strong killing the weak, but also the strong fighting the strong; and that bandos wasn't a god of vengeance. he will then give you a weapon you have no understanding of, known as thekyzaj, after which the tournament is named. he will inform you that you must use it in the final fight, which will be against the champion of theourgs, none other thangeneral graardorhimself. he advises learning how to use the weapon before starting the fight. return to zanik and she will recall bandos' memories, explaining the history of the weapon and teaching you how to wield and use it. note:if the kyzaj disappears from your inventory after teleporting, just retrieve it from zarador and use the portal to depart yu'iusk instead. there is also a bug where it will disappear the moment it is placed in your inventory after ending dialogue with zarador. just ask zarador for another. when you are ready, head back to zarador and speak with him to begin the final battle. rules for this round: you may not bring in your own weapons(you must use the kyzaj, a tier 70 weapon), and prayer is disabled. you may equip armour and jewellery, although runes and non-combat items(excluding food)are forbidden. the kyzaj will automatically equip itself once the fight starts; you will not be able to equip it beforehand. graardor attacks exclusively with melee, using his own kyzaj to attack instead of his fists like he usually does. he has several attacks, some more powerful than others: both of these attacks have separate cooldown times, meaning the player must be constantly on guard. graardor has another set of abilities to be mindful of: recommended items:for this battle, you should usesaradomin brew flasks, coupled withsuper restore flasks.restoration portentsmay also be used, thoughdegradation portentsare ineffective against graardor. it is imperative to be able to heal yourself as much as possible throughout the fight, and saradomin brew flasks effectively yield 6,000 points of healing each. this is a very involved and intimidating battle, due to the potential to be dealt large amounts of damage in a short period of time. the best and overarching strategy is to be very mindful of your health, and to keep moving throughout the fight. a simple, yet effective strategy is to remain in the central portion of the arena, moving out of the way when graardor swings his weapon at you (you'll only need to move a minimum of one (1) square to avoid being hit). immediately, this prevents you from being stomped on and damaged when graardor starts destroying the arena. with these threats out of the way, all you'll have to do is watch for when he swings his kyzaj. be very aware of when he does; you'll only have about a second to react and move out of the way once you see him raise it. using this method of staying in the centre of the platform, you'll necessarily be dealt the full amount of damage when he performs his shockwave attack, but the damage dealt with this is minimal compared to his other special attacks. two sips of saradomin brew will be enough to recover from it. there will likely be times that you are unable to move out of the way of his swinging attack, and this will often be either preceded or followed by his shockwave attack. at most, the recovery from the combination of both of these attacks will use one (1) saradomin brew flask, and a few sips of a super restore flask. the cooldown between his special attacks is enough to be able to spam-click your potions until you've replenished your health and move out of the way of his next swing. his base attacks don't pose much of a problem, so if you're running low on health just focus on spam-clicking your potions until you're comfortable. remember to restore your stats using a few sips of super restore after using saradomin brews, and you should be fine. additional tips: when you have defeated graardor, zarador will call off the fight before you can kill him. in a dramatic turn-of-events, it is revealed that he has captured zanik. he then throws her into the arena and gives you two choices: or (the subsequent appearance of your kyzaj depends on your decision to kill or spare zanik; you receive thebloodied kyzajif you kill her or thehonourable kyzajif you spare her. these can be freely exchanged after the quest.) if you choose to spare zanik, she will hug you and give a (long-rehearsed) speech to the assembled bandosians, proclaiming that they must stop making futile attacks on weaklings, and instead remain on yu'biusk to reinhabit it and test their strength. zarador will be impressed with her speech, but graardor will refuse her leadership, returning to thegod wars dungeonto continue the search for thegodsword. zarador will tell you to say your farewells to zanik. zanik will tell you that being on yu'biusk is making her feel stronger instead of weaker, and that she plans to lead the bandosians through yu'biusk to try and find a habitable place to live, or die trying. she will also ask you to go back to dorgesh-kaan and tell ur-tag that the city is safe, and to wish him the best. if you choose to kill zanik, you will be disqualified from the tournament and general graardor will be declared the leader of the bandosians. zarador, however will still honour the results of the tournament, saying that you are the strongest among them, and a true warrior of bandos. zarador will tell you that he will remain on yu'biusk, as it is his home, and he will tell you to go and speak to graardor before you leave. graardor can be found to the south-west, up the ladder and at the first bank spot to the west. he will tell you that he is happy with your decision, declaring that he will beat you 'next time', as he was 'just having a bad day'. he will also tell you that he no longer plans to ""smash the cave weaklings"" as zanik is dead and they will probably die on their own anyway. he concludes that he will return to thetemple of the lost ancientsto continue his search for thegodsword, hoping to use it to kill the other gods for the glory of bandos. return to dorgesh-kaan to tell ur-tag that the bandosians have called off the attack. depending on your decision regarding zanik, he will either be upset with you for the loss of zanik, or saddened that she has left, hoping that she finds peace on yu'biusk. either way, he will be pleased the attack is called off and will reward you. congratulations, quest complete!  the mighty fall is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: concept art of an arena encountered during the quest asuperior honourable kyzaj, a

does, however, provide insight into the history of the mahjarrat tribe. the quest revolves around the restoration ofqueen senliten, a pharaoh from thesecond age. skills: items: if leela does not show up in draynor village, you need to complete thestolen heartsanddiamond in the roughquests first, even ificthlarin's little helperis already completed. to start the quest, talk toleelaindraynor village, who can be found standing against the north fence north of the jail. she tells you about a mastaba, an ancient kind of pyramid, that is situated nearuzer. according to her, this tomb is inhabited by a pharaoh queen and leela wants you to go and gather more information on the queen. to reach theuzer mastaba, you can take one of many routes: once inside, explore all the rooms and rummage through all the skeletons (don't kill the golem guarding the stairs). they will rise up and turn into level 42skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. killing each one will provide different items, includingdesert shirts, emptywaterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up. the item that leela requires is thescroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. other items needed from the skeleton looters are acanopic jarand amummy hand. these items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. apyramid journalcan also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring senliten to 100% completion. the three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. use area-of-effect abilities likecleaveto kill the skeletons more quickly. also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. you may fail disabling it, however. gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section. talking to thegolem's remainsin the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. he also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse. none of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes,tatty bag,defective spades,shattered axes,sub-optimal lantern, andsuboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confrontali morrisanelater. return to draynor village and talk to leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self. after having spoken to leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make bothspiced wineand apot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. to make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot. the following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion. the quest only requires 75% to complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. in addition,the curse of arravrequires full completion. travel toal kharidand talk toali morrisanein the marketplace north of the lodestone, near thesilk trader. ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent thebandit lootersto get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away. give him anysq'irkjuiceobtained from thesorceress's gardenminigame. if it's your first time getting the juice, talk to osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage theapprenticeto vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. exchange the juice with ali for acopied name papyrus. then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to ali morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document – themummy's name papyrus. you find out that the queen's true name issenliten. talk to him again about the tomb. the documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominentlyreldo, the varrock palace librarian. before going to varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier fromwaseem the leaflet dropper, north of theal kharid mining site. reldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off ali, but they are incomplete. he promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. he also says that ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. give him an al kharid flyer, to which he notices that ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. after he is done, you will receive ascroll of praise. make sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. inside the uzer mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to thegolem guardat the stairs. he will keep saying 'halt!' and prevent you entry into thepharaoh queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. you will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again. descend to the lower level(note: you may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. if so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section). there are level 42small scarabswandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the threecanopic jarsand themummy with no hand. using themummy handon the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-formingsenliten's mummy. in the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs.  on the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievementuzer master, required for themaster quest cape. this room contains nothing else of interest. climb back through the ""cave in"" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level. after you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. you will find yourself before a floor puzzle. the puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit. the easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. it is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle. ... ... check progress via thepyramid journalor thescroll of the dead. you need to revive various aspects of senliten — her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. the interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. the quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for the curse of arrav quest, so make sure that you complete senliten. components of senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body. it is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy. senliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land. praying atamascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3life pointsper prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. this is also one of the tasks in thedesert tasks. note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade. you now need to light four 'enchanted sconces' using 5fire runesas fuel for each. after reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. you need to create her body double using her image. creating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. the food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink – spiced wine. you should now have 100% completion. go back and speak to leela. congratulations, quest complete! experience earned while completing the mummy: missing my mummy is directly required for the following

give you death, or at the very least ""a gift worthy for the gods themselves"" if you solve his riddles. for each of the riddles, the answer can be found in the form of an item in one of the chests next to him. the item then must then be placed on the answer plinth next to him. an additional chest will open with each riddle. after solving the last riddle, you receive an invitation to sliske's

destroyed, he will die, and the sequence will start over. to rescuedeath, head west and stamp out the flames, then head south and stamp out a second set of flames. now you get to death's cage (you may need to increase your graphics settings if you cannot see the flames). free him and return toicthlarin. talk to him and icthlarin's shield will disappear, causing death to call his scythe and teleport himself, icthlarin and you to safety just before one of strisath's fireballs hits you. sliske unleashes the dragonkin, strisath. sliske attacks icthlarin. death teleports you and icthlarin away, just in time to avoid strisath's fireball. you will arrive back insilvarea, bybrother samwell, anddeathandicthlarinwill thank you for freeing death, and also warn you that another god war will soon begin, with both the gods and mortals wishing to claim thestone of jasfor themselves. samwell will be saddened thatsliskewas not brought to justice due to his actions against his brothers, although death quickly reassures him that he will take their souls to the afterlife so they can rest in peace. with his brothers' souls at rest, samwell thanks you for your assistance and rewards you.

helpingnarnode shareenonce again by tracking down the missing10th squad. the majority of the quest is set onape atoll, an island inhabited by civilised but unfriendly and high-levelmonkeys. it has been quite some time since the 10th squad were dispatched and they have been deemed missing in action. can you unravel the mystery behind the deception? can you separate the truth from the lies? can you decide for yourself what is real and what is not? warning:this is a challenging and arduous quest. only the most hardened of adventurers need apply. to begin, speak toking narnode shareenin his abode in thetree gnome stronghold. he tells you that sinceglough's plans were foiled, he has appointed a new head tree guardian, namelydaero. although everything fares well, he is worried about the10th squad, an eliteroyal guardenvoy that he had sent tokaramjato decommission glough's shipbuilding activities. unfortunately, he hasn't heard back from them. agree to investigate, and you will be handed agnome royal seal, allowing you uninhibited access to the shipyard. ascend the tree to the top and take theglidertokaramja(gandius). on the island, head north along the coast to reach theshipyardand try to enter through the gate. a shipyard worker will stop you, but quickly withdraws once you show him the royal seal. now, speak withg.l.o. caranock, the gnome that resides in the building in the southern area of the shipyard – he doesn't provide any useful information but is seemingly acting very suspicious (you can now charter ships from anywhere to the shipyard). return toking narnode shareenand tell him about the journey. he writes up someordersthat you must convey todaero. daero can be found on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]of thegrand treeat the eastern side, nearblurberry's bar. show him the king's orders, and he'll tell you that he has been appointed the lead in a reconnaissance mission to investigate the 10th squad's whereabouts and to communicate withsergeant garkor, the squad leader. daero needs to chart a course for the unexplored region far south ofkaramja– the most probable location for finding the squad – for the human who played a major role in ousting glough and foiling his plans. being the head tree guardian, daero cannot leave the mainland and therefore wants you to get acquainted withflight commander waydar. select ""leave"" in the dialogue. since the location of his colleague is confidential, he requests you be blindfolded before he can take you to the meet. you are taken to an underground military hangar, previously planned to be used as one of the launch sites for glough, for his domination plan. here, you meet up withwaydar, who explains to daero that the squad's standard gliders must have been blown away by the tropical weather, whereas he would be using a superior, refined version in hope of locating them. unfortunately, glough has set up a mechanism in the facility which shuts down the power periodically, and it must be re-initialised to deploy these military gliders. you can leave the hangar at any time using the teleportation device at the hangar's south end, click operate on the south part of the device. speak to daero and begin the puzzle by clicking on the panel in the south-eastern region of the hangar, in front of the long pipe. your objective is to rearrange the scrambled tiles to create a complete picture. to complete the puzzle, you are provided with two choices: regardless of whether you solved the puzzle yourself or paid glough to do it, you're now ready to fly south. first speak todaero, and then towaydar– he reminds you to stock up on food and anti-poison before leaving. there may be a bug where items in your inventory will disappear after the puzzle is solved; to solve this – just log out and back in and your items will re-appear. while you are in human form, every creature on ape atoll will be aggressive. when you are ready, waydar will fly you tocrash island, where you meet with a member of the 10th squad,lumdo. he tells you that the strong winds blew their lightweight gliders onto this island. while falling, sergeant garkor noticed some land nearby and gathered his battalion to sail there in recently made boats, leaving lumdo to guard the gliders. if you ask him to take you to the land, he refuses, stating that he is under command from the sergeant to stay. relay the situation to waydar, who'll pull rank and order lumdo to take you onto the island, while he would watch the gliders. speak to waydar to travel west onto the island. a cutscene ensues, showing the shipyard foreman speaking with caranock. the foreman is worried about the recent events at the shipyard, and caranock repeatedly reassures him that he is working on a fix for the shipyard, while glough has left a few agents in the gnome force to deal with the situation. on the island, travel north from the landing point until you reach an impassable ridge and follow it west. be wary of aggressive level 14jungle snakes, level 24scorpions, and level 88jungle spiders, all of whom are poisonous and use ranged attacks. you should consider activatingprotect from missilesif you are a lower level, as it will reduce incoming damage. before entering the narrow valley, activate theprotect from missilesprayer if you have not already done so to prevent getting hit for a great deal of damage from multiple volleys of arrows. the arrows may also poison you. regardless of whether you activated the prayer or not, you will be knocked out unconscious. you awake in a prison cell, closely guarded by gorillas, namelytrefajiandaberab. the nearby cells hold a few members of the 10th squad –lumo,bunkdoandcarado. speak to lumo, who'll tell you that they've had no luck in their attempts at escape but that you might have better luck in lock-picking the gate. your aim is to unlock the prison door and escape the jail. if you come within two squares of the gorillas' range, even if you are inside the cell, you will be punched back and dealt up to 20% of your current life points as typeless damage, so be very attentive. the gorillas patrol their route through the corridor twice, before switching. take the time to observe their pattern. as soon as the patrolling gorilla turns to walk back up the path towards the other gorilla, pick the lock and run behind him. be careful not to run ahead of him as he moves slowly. as soon as he is in the guard room to the north-west, run out of the jail and hide in the tall grass along the northern wall of the jail. speaking to a monkey, with the exception ofhafuba, will have you thrown back into jail. findkaram, the 10th squad's high assassin, in the jungle grass just east of the prison (he appears in other places on the island, but you will not be able to talk to him elsewhere). he isn't very informative, but he lets you know that he is there if you need any help. stay in the grass and travel south against the western wall of thetemple of marimbo. the archer monkeys do not shoot at players hiding in the grass; however, there is an open stretch of ground at the south-western corner of the temple, so protect from missiles must be switched on past the temple archway. go east along the wall of the temple and around the monkey palace to the south to meet up withsergeant garkor, the 10th squad leader. when you speak to garkor about your mission, he tells you that he's been in contact with narnode and was, in fact, the one vital for getting you on the job. after landing on the monkey colony, garkor has been secretly eavesdropping in on the conversations ofking awowogei, the self-proclaimed leader of the island. to eliminate any casualties, he needs an insider working with the monkeys. garkor says his squad mages and sappers are currently working underground and his head mage,zooknock, would be able to help you better mingle with the locals (youmustfinish the conversation with garkor, otherwise zooknock will not enchant your items). there is no need to immediately go to zooknock. instead, it is strongly recommended to obtain the items needed for themonkeyspeak amuletbefore you first visit zooknock. the monkey greegree ingredients cannot be obtained prior to talking to zooknock. to create the monkeyspeak amulet, you require somemonkey dentures, am'amulet mouldand a gold bar. for the dentures and mould, you must head to the u-shaped building in the southern side of the colony. it is east of the general store and west of the mini summoning obelisk. make sure to enter the building using the southern entrance, since thenorthern one will result in you being captured. when inside, ensure that you stay on the dark brown ground at the perimeter of the room, otherwise the nearby sleeping monkey guard will catch you and summon his comrades to send you back to jail. if you are having difficulty differentiating between the light and dark ground, the minimum graphics setting presents a much better contrast. staying on the darkened ground, search the set of stacked crates on the light brown ground towards the east side, for somemonkey dentures. next, search the south-easternmost crate to crawl down into the basement – you may fall and take up to 3250 damage. look through the crates in the north-west part of the basement to find one that is full ofm'amulet moulds. take one, then teleport out, or go back up the ladder next to where you fell. be warned that if you do go back up the way you came, then you will arrive directly in sight of the monkey guard upstairs and be thrown back into jail. this can be avoided if you can quickly exit through the southern door and make your way into the tall grass. if you did not bring resources (anti-poison, food, etc) or need to restock, now is the time to bank and get more items. with the amulet ingredients in your inventory, head to zooknock. zooknock can be found in thedungeonlocated in the southern part ofape atoll. to exit the city, climb the ladder on the scaffolding just south of garkor and jump down. be wary of a monkey wandering the graveyard around the ladder: he can call the monkey guards to send you back to into prison. it is also possible to teleport out and come back to the island by speaking to daero, thereby avoiding the monkey in the graveyard and reaching the dungeon. once you're back in the jungle region, head straight west and go down the ladder into the dungeon. to reach the gnome, you must navigate through the dungeon, passing the monsters, traps and falling rocks. activatingprotect from meleewill significantly reduce the amount of damage taken while travelling through the dungeon. thesurgeanddiveabilities can be used to get across traps without taking damage. speak to zooknock at the end of the dungeon and he'll tell you about their story after arriving on the heavily guarded island. tell him that you are there on garkor's suggestion of having an insider, and he explains that since humans are more closely linked to monkeys than gnomes, you are the perfect candidate for the mission. to complete the transformation, he needs objects into which he can store the magical power required to communicate with the monkeys as well as maintain the monkey form – he suggests getting a talisman for the disguise and an amulet for communicating with the monkeys. zooknock provides you with a list of items that are needed to create the required objects. use the mould, the dentures, and a gold bar on zooknock. he tells you that he has enchanted the gold with the power from the dentures, and you must smith it into an amulet only at a location that is sacred to the monkeys, otherwise the effect will soon wear off; he returns themonkeyspeak amulet mouldand also gives you anenchanted bar. return to the monkey colony and travel east towards the temple. withprotect from meleeon, enter the temple and climb down the trapdoor along the eastern wall of the temple. if it is blocked by the ape guards, simply climb a ladder where there are very few guards, and back down the one leading right next to the trapdoor. the guards in the temple will attack you if you get too close, however they will not send you to jail. in the basement are two pillars offireand lots of zombie monkeys, so do not turn off protect from melee. use the enchanted bar with either fire to create an unstrung amulet. if you do not have the monkeyspeak amulet mould in your backpack, you will get the message ""you do not have anything suitable for smithing an enchanted bar"". use a ball of wool on it to complete themonkeyspeak amulet. while the amulet does give you the ability to talk to monkeys, talking to them (except for the monkey child) without a disguise will result in you being thrown into monkey jail. return to ape atoll to be placed in the jail cell; escape another time. under the safety of the jungle grass, travel a short distance west to the banana garden. wait forthe monkey's auntto leave through the southern entrance and quickly go into the garden through the corridor at its north-east corner. when she is returning through the western gate, run back into the corridor to avoid being detected by the aunt. if you fail this step, you'll be ambushed by ninja monkeys and sent back to jail (though you will get to keep the bananas that you took from the trees); if she does spot you, just climb up the stairs and wait for about five seconds. equip themonkeyspeak amuletand speak to themonkey childin the garden. you must talk to him twice, before telling him that you are his uncle. the child, still at an innocent age, agrees with you and tells you that his aunt has promised to gift him a toy, if he can manage to get 20bananasfor her. offer to retrieve the bananas for him and pick some from the trees. you only need to obtain 5 bananas for the child, as he cannot yet count. hide in the corridor as many times as required, and finally hand over the bananas to the monkey in exchange for amonkey talisman. you must now return to the dungeon again to where zooknock is and use the regularmonkey bones(or corpse) and the talisman on him. using the wrong type of bone will make zooknock give you a non-regular greegree. if bringing bones, it is recommended to get more than one set as you may accidentally bury them. in the event that you bring the wrong bones, you will still receive a type ofgreegreebut it will not be the one you need to progress with the quest. you'll know that you had the wrong bones if zooknock gives you anything other than amonkey greegree. the greegree will still work as a disguise on the island, and you can use it to buy another talisman fromtutab's magical marketfor zooknock to make you the proper greegree.ninja monkey greegree,zombie monkey greegree, orgorilla greegreewill not work for this quest. they are used for another quest,recipe for disaster, you can prepare them for convenience. he will enchant the talisman into amonkey greegree, allowing you to transform into a monkey and blend inside the colony. unfortunately, zooknock was not able to completely infuse his magic and therefore the greegree has a limited working range, only working on ape atoll, and the wielder is unable to use weapons in the disguised form. acutsceneensues, in which caranock and waydar are seen having a conversation in theisland's banana plantation. having been part of a conspiracy all along, waydar informs caranock of the current situation. caranock tells him that they need to finish glough's mission and that he has hatched a plan to do just so. he wants to execute the entire10th squadand blame their deaths on the karamjan humans, forcing narnode to act recklessly out of anger and maybe even invade the human kingdoms. return to the monkey colony with the amulet and greegree equipped. in the karamjan monkey form, you are free to roam around unhindered, which means you will not be approached or attacked by any of the locals and the entrance guards, although you may still be damaged by traps, poison, or theape atoll agility course. you can pick bananas from the trees by the child to restore your health without eating your inventory food. head to the south-east part of the colony and speak to garkor. impressed with your outfit, he wants you to seek an audience withawowogeiby pretending to be a karamjan envoy, here to seek an alliance with him. try to enter the throne room, but you'll be stopped by anelder guard, who informs you that only the captain of the monkey guard, or people authorised by him, are allowed to speak to the king. the guard points you in the direction of the captain, namedkruk. to get to him, head west to beyond the town gate and climb to the vantage point of the hill from its south-west entrance. next, climb the ladder and walk across the bridge and down the other side. speak to kruk there and request him to allow you to speak to the king. he assesses you and agrees to solicit a meeting between you and awowogei. inside the throne room, speak to the monkey king and play an envoy's part. when you tell him that the karamjan monkeys would like to serve under his rule, awowogei decides to test your mettle. he agrees to sign a pact if you can use your resourcefulness to rescue amonkeyfrom theardougne zooand bring it to him. head to the ardougne zoo any way you can (make sure to either unequip your greegree, or keep a free inventory space before teleporting, otherwise you will lose your greegree and you will need to obtain another one). enter the zoo and wield the greegree again. you must use the regular monkey greegree, not the ninja monkey greegree. try talking to themonkey mindernear the northern entrance, and he'll catch you and put you inside with the other monkeys. speak to any one of the monkeys and convince them to jump into your inventory. now, unequip the greegree and speak to the minder to be let out of the enclosure. do not teleportwith themonkeyin the inventory or he will run off. using teleportation channels such asspirit treesand thefairy ringswill also cause the monkey to disappear. since the monkey cannot be banked, your only option is to walk or run to thegrand treeand talk todaeroto return to ape atoll. equip the greegree and head back to king awowogei. when you speak to him, the monkey is automatically freed from the inventory and he applauds you on a job well done, although he still needs some time to consider your proposal. exit the throne room and speak to garkor. he grimly tells you that your efforts might have gone in vain, since his comrades in the atoll dungeon –waymottinandbunkwicket– have just overheard a conversation between waydar, caranock and awowogei. the gnomes have convinced awowogei to get rid of the 10th squad; in exchange for his services, caranock agrees to let awowogei keep the ""pet"" that will be sent to him as an aid. speak togarkoragain. he tells you that he has consulted with zooknock and the both of them have come up with a solution to the dilemma. since the conspirators plan to teleport in the entire 10th squad, garkor reckons that this must be possible due to the sigils that are exclusive to the members. to get around glough's magic, garkor has had one of his sappers create a copy of the10th squad sigilfor you, to reinforce their squad for whatever trap they are being led in. rubbing the sigil will teleport you to the final battle, so do not rub it until you are ready. the foe that you must defeat to save the 10th squad is a level 70jungle demon, having 15,000 life points but a fairly low defence. it uses magic attacks if you are out of range and both magic and melee when within two squares of it. it does not have any particular weakness to a combat style. players with combat stats of 70+ need not bring food or potions, you will be able to kill the demon very easily. some points to consider before rubbing the sigil are: the battle with the jungle demon. where to stand while the gnomes attack the demon. the jungle demon dies. once the demon is dead, talk to garkor, who tells you to relay the news to king narnode. to leave the arena, speak to zooknock to be teleported to the ape atoll jungle. if you decline his offer, zooknock will leave and your only means of exiting would be by speaking tobonzarainside the gorilla statue, at the centre of the arena; bonzara too will teleport you into the ape atoll jungle. speak to king narnode in the grand tree to finish the quest. congratulations, quest complete! for additional rewards, speak to daero after the quest to receive experience from the 10th squad training programme. you may now choose to distribute the experience in either one of the given sets, which are defence and attack, and strength and constitution – the first chosen set will give you 35,000 experience in each skill, while giving 20,000 experience in each of the skills in the second set. monkey madness is directly

has she run away? has she been eaten by trolls? or is there something more sinister going on? only you can find out. make your way to the area east ofrellekkaand north of thegolden tree. to get to that area, you can use thefremennik province lodestoneand head east towards the mountain and then south, anenchanted lyreand head east, walk north fromseers' village, use thefairy ringcodeajror aring of slayingand then go north-west a bit, or, if your house is in rellekka, teleport to yourhouseand go east. alternatively, afterlove story, one can make arellekka tabletto teleport outside of the house portal in rellekka. start up the path to themountain camp, just north of themusician, and attempt to climb over therockslide. the guard says you are not welcome and does not allow you to pass. go north, and climb thecliffsidewith a rope in your inventory. interacting with the rockslide is not necessary to climb the cliffside. follow the path into the village, enter the longhouse to the east, and speak tohamal the chieftainto begin the quest. ask him why everyone is so hostile. speaking of his tribe, hamal tells you that they are citizens ofrellekka, although due to differences they have moved out to become closer to nature, disagreeing with the fremennik tradition of choosing their tools over skill. the chieftain tells you about his missing daughter and after much arguing against ""employing"" an outerlander, he eventually allows you to search for her. from this point on, you can enter the camp by climbing over the rockslide. head south of hamal's house, and take somemudfrom the bubbling mud pond. select either dig-belowrootsor dig-upmudin the mud pond. go north of hamal's house and pick up one plank and pole from the fenced pen. do not pick up the broken pole by the lake, as it will not work. just north of the mountain goats is a notably large lake and a path leading east up to the lakeside; follow it and head west until you findragnar. he tells you that the chieftain's daughter,asleif hamalsdotter, is his fiancée. she used to sing near the mountains, but has since disappeared. ragnar says that he is waiting patiently by the lake for her to return. use the mud you gathered on thetall treenear ragnar to prevent yourself from slipping (swamp taralso works in place of the mud). climb the tall tree, crawl along its branch, and jump down to the little island. use your pole or staff on theclump of rocksto pole-vault over them, and then the plank to cross theflat stone. on one of the bubbles rising from the pool, select ""listen-to shining pool"". this only works when you're standing near the rock in the centre of the island. once you are on the island, listen-to theshining poolto the south to talk to the chieftain's daughter. you hear the voice of the spirit of the chieftain's daughter, who is dead. she asks you to make peace between her tribe and rellekka and to also find a new food source for the camp. agree to help her. to return to shore, use a plank on the flat stone. you can do her two tasks in either order. return to the mountain camp, and talk to hamal the chieftain. ask about the people of rellekka, and he tells you that he sent a villager namedsvidito initiate a simple trade route, but he hasn't yet returned. teleport to the fremennik province lodestone. locate and speak with svidi. svidi can be found roaming this area between the mountains to the east and rellekka to the west. he will tell you he's afraid of thefremennikin rellekka and thinks that they might kill him. select the persuade option and he will agree, if you can secure a promise from the chieftain that he will be safe. head to rellekka, and talk tobrundt the chieftainin the longhall. he will promise not to hurt svidi if you can retrieve a relic — an ancient rock — that the mountain camp tribe stole from rellekka long ago. return to the mountain camp, and enter the large tent south-west ofhamal the chieftain. use your pickaxe on theancient rocklocated in the southern tent to gethalf a rock. take this back to rellekka, and talk to brundt the chieftain, who will agree to share the rock and give you thesafety guarantee. go and take the guarantee to svidi to initiate peace talks between the two tribes. return again to the mountain camp, and speak with hamal, then talk tojokul, who is in the tent north of hamal, looking after hisgoats. he thinks the members of the mountain camp could survive if the seed of awhite pearlfruit, a hearty plant which can grow even in the most difficult of circumstances and grow on mountains. the white pearl may be found onwhite wolf mountain. the fastest way to access white wolf mountain is by either teleporting to the catherby or burthorpe lodestone, and heading north to the peak or by teleporting to the al kharid lodestone and taking thegnome glider. using one of the methods above, travel to the slope beneath the peak and look forthorny bushesnear the glider. put on your gloves, pick awhite pearlfruit off the thorny bushes and eat it. you will automatically spit out thewhite pearl seed. you must have talked tojokulbefore being able to pick the fruit. if you are not wearing gloves, you will be hit for 40 damage. if you receive the message: ""ouch! you just stuck your hand into some very sharp thorns"" and are wearing gloves, try a different pair of gloves. you must eat the fruit to gain the seed - after obtaining the seed, you can use the fremennik province lodestone to return to rellekka and run south-east to the mountain camp. give thewhite pearl seedto hamal, who accepts your solution for feeding the tribe. after you've completed both tasks, go back to the centre of the shining pool and ""listen-to"" the shining pool again. she asks you to convince her father that she is really dead. she was attacked by a creature and dragged off nearby to the north, where she was killed. attempt to jump across the flat stone (without the plank) and you will swim to the northern bank of the pool. follow the path east to a cave blocked by dead trees. chop down the ones that block your path with ahatchetuntil you reach a cave entrance. if you've not fully completed both tasks in the steps above and gone through the dialogue completely, you'll receive a message referring to a stench that prevents you from entering the cave. repeat the steps until you're allowed to enter the cave. once you enter the cave, make your way to the large cavern. you findthe kendalas well as numerous corpses near a central pillar. talk to the kendal, and when it asks who you are, say ""it's just me, no one special"".  then say ""you mean a sacrifice?"" the kendal tells you that it is the god of the northern lands. say that he actually looks like a man in a bearsuit, to which he finally admits. after you blow his cover, he also confesses to killing asleif more than 10 years ago, although it was an accident. humbly request her remains, to which he refuses as he cannot

directly whereroving elvesleft off. during the quest, the player is given access tolletya, the hideout of the rebel elves, and meets witharianwyn. the first half of a two-part-quest about stopping themourners, it revolves around their plans in west ardougne. he believes there is more to the mourners than meets the eye, and he wishes for you to find out just what they're up to. can you gain the trust of the mourners? items marked with†can easily be obtained during the quest. to start the quest, talk toelunedinisafdar. she will either be just east of thetyras camp, in a secluded spot south of a stick trap, or south-east of thelletya mine, near a couple ofmagic trees. as before,islwynand she switch locations every five minutes. she will inform you thatarianwyn, whom you last met in front ofking lathas's castle, wishes to speak to you inlletyabefore offering to take you there. eluned leads you to an elven village and gives you ateleport crystalwith a few charges, allowing you to return to lletya with ease. she is not as skilled as the elf who originally sung the crystal though, therefore you will need to see her to have it recharged when it runs out. eluned then returns to islwyn, leaving you to meet with arianwyn. have a look around if you wish - arianwyn may be found in the large building to the east, on theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us]. there is a bank in the same building. arianwyn is glad to see you and reports that there is an increasing number ofmournerscrossing thearandar pass. when you are confused as to what the ardougne plague healers would be doing in thegalarpos mountains, he explains that they are really elves fromprifddinasin disguise, and that lathas is making everyone think they are healing the plague. since the elves have been unable to sneak intowest ardougnedue to being recognised by the mourners at once, it is your mission to infiltrate their ranks and find out what they are up to. however, he has no idea how to do so, and suggests you form a plan, starting with the fact that there are mourners at arandar. you will need to kill mourners to get a disguise. to find a mourner to kill for their clothes, make your way to arandar, either by heading to the entrance on thekandarinside, or exiting lletya and heading north to the tirannwn side. the mourners roaming about the surface of west ardougne do not drop the gear. you have to pass a set of trees west of the village, then head west past the tripwire and through the dense forest, then north, passing a leaf trap. alternatively, teleport to the tirannwn lodestone, head towards the north eastern path, over the leaf trap, west through the dense forest, and north over a second leaf trap. head north a bit to find more dense forest to the north east (not the north west patch), before appearing at the river – cross it using the fallen log, evade another tripwire, then head east to the pass. either way, you will indeed notice mourners periodically walking eastwards through the pass. the mourners are not very powerful and can easily be dispatched. the mourners will drop a set ofmourner outfit– consisting of agas mask, abloody mourner top,damaged mourner trousers,mourner boots,gloves, and acloak, in addition to aletterfrom prifddinas stating that the carrier has passed all requirements to join thedeath guard. if you are planning on doingwithin the light, you will need a second full set of mourning gear which you can get now. these, too, will have to be cleaned and repaired as follows. you can also get another set in the mourners' headquarters in the next step. unfortunately, there is a blood stain on the mourner top, and the trousers are torn. obviously, you will need to repair the clothing before infiltrating the mourners. to remove the stains from thebloody mourner top, go totaverleyand talk totegid, the druid doing his laundry inlake crystalmere, just south-west of thepet shop. he tells you about his specialsoapthat can remove any stain, which he will not let you have, as he does not have much left in stock and still has a lot to wash, or alternatively if you have completed the questeadgar's rusehe is still angry about you taking hisdirty robeswhile helping madeadgarearlier. proceed to steal the soap from his basket. using that and a bucket of water, wash the blood stains out of the mourner top, which you will be able to wear from now on. to fix the trousers, go back to lletya and talk tooronwen, the seamstress located in the north-west part of lletya. she will be able to mend them if you bring her two pieces ofsilkand onebear fur. you can kill a grizzly bear just to the south-west of lletya for the bear fur, if you don't have it. there are magic trees in this area too if you need a magic log. oronwen will take the trousers to mend them, and in one minute they will be ready to be collected. make sure you have an empty backpack space to accept the trousers, as they will be lost if the backpack is full. if you don't have your dyes yet, you can buy them from oronwen while you are waiting for her to mend the trousers. make your way to themourners' headquarterslocated at the north-east corner of west ardougne where you had poisoned their stew earlier. make sure you are wearing all six pieces of the mourner suit and nothing else, enter the building. once inside the building, climb down the trapdoor: you will find yourself in an underground base with several patrolling mourners holdingcrystal halberds. locate thehead mourner(not the sameoneyou encountered while rescuingelena) in his office and talk to him. the head mourner will take your letter of recommendation and welcome you to the death guard. he will tell you that the mourners' job is to keep people believing in the plague. ask for more explanation, and he will reveal that the mourners have dyedfarmer brumty's sheep, making him think they have fallen ill with the plague (which, in turn, prompted theardougne city councilto request your help in dealing with them). however, the colour is starting to wash away and you are required to re-apply the dye to keep up the hoax, making sure to use the correct colours for the respective sheep and to remain unseen. normally, they would use a gnome-made device that would fire ""fat green parcels that rupture on impact,"" but they have run out and the device has broken. the head mourner gives you thebroken deviceand atarnished keyto open the cell where agnome inventoris being held for torture. use the key to enter the cell, and speak to the gnome on the rack. unsurprisingly, he refuses to repair the device and states that no form of torture will make him cooperate, not even having his eyelids stretched, his nostrils set on fire or his toes nibbled on by rabid rabbits. having playedgnomeballas a child, he is able to withstand all forms of pain. however, he accidentally discloses that he hates having his feet tickled and lovestoad crunchies. do not use your toad crunchies before using feathers on him, or you will be required to go back and make more toad crunchies. use your feather on him to tickle his feet, to which he will beg you to stop, although he is still not inclined to help on the grounds that his expertise is the only thing keeping him out of the slave pens. repeat the process, this time also holding the crunchies just out of his reach – this time he succumbs and agrees to fix the device if you bring him someleatherand amagic log. you may give him some crunchies if you want to and he will be grateful, but you will require more if you do. if you feed him two extras, he just says thanks. once you have all the items, talk to him and agree to release him, which is done by the ""release"" option on him. the gnome may disappear completely upon releasing it. this is a bug. just exit the area via the ladder that leads up to the main level, and re-enter through the trapdoor. logging out and back in can also solve this issue. a mourner will stop you, but you explain that the gnome must be untied to fix the device, after which the mourner will be convinced. after some time, speak to the gnome again to collect thefixed device. however, you still need to find replacements for the fat green parcels. if you speak to the gnome again, he'll note in true gnomish fashion that ""toads should be in everything"". travel to thefeldip hills(e.g. by using the fairy ring codeaks). if you don't have the ogre bellows, you will need to get one from the chest in the cave on the east, near to rantz. you need to catchtoadsas if you were huntingchompy birdsand colour them with dyes to mimic the launcher's regular ammunition. to do so, you must first load your ogre bellows (they can be retrieved fromrantz' cave if lost) with a bottle of dye of a certain colour (blue, red, green and yellow are required), which can be bought fromlletya seamstress, oronwen's shop, or made by aggie, the witch in draynor village, using other items. if your ogre bellows has swamp gas in it, catch toads and let them go, in order to use up the gas. after filling your bellows with dye, use them to catch a couple of toads near any of the pools in the feldip hills. repeat this process for all four dyes so that you haveblue,red,green, andyellow toads. next, make your way to the fields north ofeast ardougne, where brumty's sheep roam. there are four sets of sheep (pale red, pale blue, pale green, and pale yellow) with three sheep in each set. only one sheep needs to be dyed per set. stand a few steps away from the sheep and identify its colour (examining one reveals this if you are not certain). use the correspondingcoloured toadson the fixed launcher device, thus ""loading"" it, and then wield the launcher. to fire the device, open theworn equipmenttab, then right-click the fixed device and select the option ""fire"". use the arrows to aim at a sheep and then press the middle ""fire!"" button once it is in the middle of the screen. once you have dyed one (set of) sheep, you will need to unequip the fixed device, reload it, and then re-equip it, repeating the process. make sure to only fire at a sheep if it is exactly in the middle of the screen. otherwise, you will lose your toad, and may potentially need to return to the feldip hills to obtain more. if your device crosshairs are not centred in your game window, choose a different ""quick load layout"" from the options menu (more informationhere) - there is a bug that causes the crosshairs to be displayed in the wrong location.  if pressing 'fire' produces an error message asking you to finish what you are doing or leave the area then you need to exit to lobby and relog to proceed. once allsick-looking sheephave had their colour reapplied, return to the head mourner. he will praise your enthusiasm and provide you with another task: to ensure that a couple of people fall victim to the ""plague"" to maintain the hoax. he tells you that someone recently poisoned the mourners' stew which gave them plague-like symptoms. he asks you to find out what this substance was so that you can use it on the citizens of west ardougne - that way they become ill and can be taken to the headquarters to work as slaves for the mourners. spreading the poison should be easy since all food comes from only three supply points within the city walls. you will need to poison two of these. if you don't already have a rotten apple, get one now. go back upstairs and outside to the west of the building. it is alongside the tanning line, just west of the fence by the death guard headquarters. pay your old friendelenaa visit, who lives slightly north east of ardougne castle. she will initially mistake you for a mourner if you are wearing their full attire, but you will reveal your identity. you tell her that you need to make a poison based on arotten appleand describe how you used one to poison the mourners while investigating the plague, from which she will conclude that it's most likely a mould that did the trick. you mention that you need to poison the city to her dismay, but you attempt to convince her that you need to gain the mourners' trust to save west ardougne from a fate even worse. she will ask for more explanation, to which you will provide a summary of events since you last saw her, and she will now agree to help you, on the condition that the toxin is not lethal. she asks for a sample of the apple so she can see if she can make an antidote. after you give it to her, wait a minute and then speak to her again. she will have found out that the toxin is a byproduct of the mould and that it's fairly weak. however, large quantities will be needed to poison half of the city's supply, and it will have to be refined to avoid suspicion. she tells you how to produce the toxin: you are given asieveto help with the third step. elena mentioned that the required solvent could be found in a book that she doesn't remember, referencingthe big book of bangswhich you found inregicide. you will need abarrel of naphtha, as you did in that quest. as elena suggested, go to the fenced-in appleorchardnorth-west of her house, south of thetree gnome stronghold, and immediately west of thecombat training camp. pick up the barrel and use it on one of therotten apple pilesto fill it, then use the barrel of rotten apples on theapple barrelnext to the pile to mash them up and receive theapple barrel. use the naphtha to dissolve your mashed apples. next, strain thenaphtha apple mixusing your sieve to obtain a solution oftoxic naphtha. finally, evaporate the solvent by heating the mixture on a cookingrange. do not use an open fire, as the naphtha will explode, forcing you to start over from scratch. use the range located on the ground floor of the mourner's hq, and you will receive two white heaps oftoxic powder(and get an empty barrel back). you now need to deposit the toxin in two of the three food supplies in west ardougne. these supply points are in the form of sacks of grain. they may be found outside thegeneral storein the south-west corner of west ardougne, upstairs in the west ardougne church, which is south of the town square, and inside thecivic office of west ardougne. it does not matter which you choose. with your task complete, return to the head mourner in the headquarters. he will be content and remark that theslavepens will soon be full again. you will ask what the slaves are needed for and he will tell you about the mourners' recent discovery, stating that you have proven yourself worthy. he reveals that, soon after the death guard had taken control of west ardougne, they found out about a legendary power source beneath the galarpos, using the slaves taken from the city to dig towards it. however, a constant supply of slaves is required due to powerfulbeastsslaughtering a few every day. according to the head mourner, a book spoke of an ancient temple built by early elven settlers around an altar of unknown origin giving access to very powerful magic. acquiring this power should significantly speed up thedark lord's return. the mourner mentions that he has another task for you, but that you are not able to receive it yet because the locksmith is copying the key for the door to the excavation site. therefore he orders you to report in regularly until they return.

thetemple of light. watch out for the pair of aggressive shadows lurking here; they hit high, but only have 100 life points, so they can be slain easily. you will also notice several corpses lying around as you approach the temple, both dead mourners andslaves. search them to identify them as the dead dig team. you will realise you have to tell arianwyn while keeping the head mourner in the dark. one of the dead mourners will carry acolour wheeland hisjournal. read it to find out his identity,nissyen edern. the journal details how he joined the mourners and leftprifddinasforwest ardougne. the colour wheel will become helpful later in this quest andwithin the light. before returning to arianwyn, ascend the stairs that are west of the entrance where you found the dead bodies and head south until you reach a ladder going up. ascend this and head north again, going around two sets of stairs. then, head east until you are right above the entrance to the temple. there is a darkened crystal here; search it and choose to chisel off a piece to receive ablackened crystal. return to arianwyn in lletya with the blackened crystal. arianwyn will realise that the safeguard of the temple, built millennia ago to protect an ancient altar, has failed, which means the shadows have become free to roam outside its perimeters. he will ask you to return to the temple to find the darkened crystal, and return a sample of it to him (this is the blackened crystal which you already collected). arianwyn concludes from the sample that a skilled crystal chanter should be able to make a replacement so he summonseluned, who will agree to chant a new one. use the blackened crystal on her to show it to her and she will proceed to create anewly made crystalreplacement. speak to arianwyn again, who will tell you that you need to reach the altar in the temple and imbue the newly made crystal with its power, then placing it into the original crystal, thus restoring the safeguards and preventing the mourners from accessing the temple. return to the temple of light with the newly made crystal. you now have to reach the altar, but the entrance is blocked by an impassable door of light. to open it, you will have to direct a light beam to it. this, however, is not as easy. in order to be able to do this, you will first have to unlock several other doors by directing beams of light at them in order to get the crystals and mirrors necessary to make the light beam reach the final door. beware of the shadows while doing this. several important things to note: upon returning to the temple, ascend the stairs and head to the crystal collector to the east. pull the lever. you might have to adjust your camera angle to see the lever protruding out from the wall. the area in which the option is given to pull the lever is quite small. next, click collect. you will receive fourhand mirrorsand ayellow crystal. yellow is complementary to blue according to the colour wheel, so you will have to use it to unlock the blue door. since you are provided with only four mirrors, the light beam's path will be relatively short. after finding the blue door, use the mirrors and the pillars to direct the light beam (coloured yellow by the crystal you placed inside one of the pillars) onto it, thus making in passable. think like this while solving the puzzle. sometimes, you will need to use multiple crystals to mix colours in order to open a certain door. below is a step-by-step guide of how to unlock each door, but you should be able to work it out yourself using the above tips. if you are short on backpack spaces, seequick guideon where to already drop new key and which rock to use the rope on, to free two backpack spaces. go back to the crystal collector and pull the lever. collect all of the items (8 total). you should now have 2 crystals (yellow and cyan) and 6 mirrors. should you not be able to collect the crystals and the mirrors from the tray by pulling the lever, the problem can usually be solved by climbing down and up the nearby stairs (resetting the floor). click down, then click back up the stairs, when you run towards the crystal collector click to open it before you get to it, this allows the proper menu to load. you have already opened the blue door; the complementary colour to cyan is red, but there is no red door. you'll need to mix cyan and yellow light, creating green light, of which the complementary colour is magenta. you will have to unlock the magenta door with it. go back to the crystal collector and collect all. alternatively, you cannot reset/collect and just alter the setup for the magenta door (see quick guide). do not reset the maze yet (by going to the crystal collector) as most of the mirror setup for the cyan door is needed for the next step of unlocking the yellow door. you now need to open two doors, a new magenta door and a new yellow door using the fractured crystal. go back to the crystal collector, pull the lever and collect all of the items (14 total). you now need to open two doors: a new cyan door and a huge black door, using everything you have (13 mirrors, 5 crystals and one more green crystal which is already placed in a pillar). go back to the crystal collector and pull the lever, collecting all of the items. you now need to get a red beam, a blue beam, and a green beam of light pointed at the column in the final room. this will make a new clear beam that you can use to enter the black door. the green beam then passes into the pillar to the west. a mirror is already placed in that pillar, so the beam is reflected down to the ground floor, and then reflected into the final pillar. the blue beam then passes into the next pillar. a mirror is already placed in that pillar, so the beam is reflected into a pillar on the ground floor, then reflected into the final pillar. from this point, if you look down you'll be able to see both the blue and green beams hitting the final pillar. the pillar in the middle of the room has a mirror fused into place (you'll see a message in the chat box), reflecting the red light beam into a pillar on the ground floor, and then into the cyan door. you can skip this section if you already have adeath talisman,omni-talisman, or awicked hoodfed with either. just enter the death altar and skip to thenext section. if you teleport away, make sure you turn the mirror back towards the cyan door. after passing through the black door, you notice the dwarfthorgelstanding next to the entrance. you'll ask each other how you got to the altar, and he will reveal there is a passage from theunderground passcreated by him and his companions. you will ask if he knowsklank, after which he will realise you are the one who slewiban. because of this, he agrees to trade you adeath talismanin return for some supplies. he gives you anitem listthat tells you what you need to get him. if you bring thorgel each of the fifty items on the list, he'll give you a death talisman. you can give these items to thorgel in multiple trips;

and he sells them, so players will not need to carry these items with them for the duration of the quest. players do not need to prepare for combat initially but must, however, be able to fend off occasional attacks from aggressive trolls as they navigate thetroll stronghold. there will be no direct confrontations until the end of the quest. players should bear in mind they will be travelling vast distances several times in this quest, requiring either a lot of lengthy running or a notable amount of teleporting to various locations. players will need to be capable of navigating the troll mountain. once you are geared up, travel to thetroll stronghold. after entering, go south and then downstairs to find the kitchen - the trolls in here are not aggressive. speak toburntmeat, who will tell you that he has heard humans are able to growgoutweed. he will ask the player for help, and after agreeing, a short cutscene will follow. you can usetrollheim teleportand walk to the cave, then just climb down the stairs, putting you north of the kitchen. in the cutscene, the player sees a capturedadventurerwho has been stripped of his armour and items and placed in a largecauldron. while the captured adventurer pleads for his life, burntmeat discovers somegoutweedin the adventurer's discardeddragon platelegs. the adventurer decides to tell burntmeat where he obtained the goutweed, in exchange for his release. however, burntmeat does not release him and instead continues to turn him into what burntmeat calls a ""tasty broth."" the player is furious after burntmeat tells them that he ate the adventurer. burntmeat attempts to justify cooking and eating the adventurer by claiming that the ""adventurer stew"" gave him an awful stomachache. burntmeat reflects that he might have forgotten to wash the adventurer's bare feet before securing him into the cauldron and boiling him alive and then when he was cooked his unwashed feet contaminated the stew resulting in the stomach ache. after recovering from the previous cutscene, burntmeat will now ask the player to teach his assistantmy armhow to farm goutweed. the player agrees to help burntmeat because he tells the player he will never cook another human again, as goats taste just as good as humans when seasoned with goutweed. the player thinks it is a good idea to assist burntmeat as they consider that it could save other humans from suffering the fate of being boiled and devoured like the adventurer. if you ask for the adventurer's items (dragon chain armour set andabyssal whip) as a reward,burntmeatwill tell you that he threw them away after attempting to eat them, saying ""red metalhurt burntmeat's teeth"" after telling the player how the abyssal whip got stuck in his throat. after hearing this your player says he's worse than thewise old man, who wouldn't hand over hisblue partyhat. my armcan now be found in the eastern part of the room near the goat pen. talk to him and he will inform the player that another man shared the same fate as the adventurer, but at the troll camp on death plateau. when he was cooked, he had something on him similar to goutweed. the player must retrieve agoutweedy lumpfrom the cooking pot atdeath plateau. if you already have agout tuberon you or in your bank, then this is the beginning of a few humorous conversations throughout the quest. talk toburntmeatto receive directions to the death plateau. the goutweed can be found in acooking potin the middle of thedeath plateau camp. to travel there directly, equip a pair of climbing boots now, in order to traverse themountainous rocks. the path from thetroll strongholdjail exit, discovered in thedeath plateauquest, can be used to reach the fortified area of the death plateau without being attacked. if the player does not have any climbing boots, they may purchase them fromfreda(on the route to death plateau fromburthorpe) for 12 coins. a faster route, not requiring climbing boots, is to travel north from burthorpe - this method involves running pasttroll throwers; usingprotect from missilesis advised for lower levels. with an empty bucket in your backpack, search cooking pot next toashanddungto retrieve thegoutweedy lump. upon retrieving it, the cooks will proceed to attack you in the hope of cooking you as well. take the item back to thetroll strongholdand talk tomy armagain. he will take you outside to the roof, where he has been practicing his ""farming"". players will notice that he has attempted to plant items such as a whole goat. speak to him again on the roof and he will give you afarming manual. in this manual, you will learn that you need 3bucketsofcamel dungand 7 buckets ofsupercompostto properly prepare the mountain soil for farming. talk to my arm and tell him you have learned how to prepare the soil. then with a spade in your backpack or tool belt, use the buckets of supercompost and ugthanki dung on thesoil patch. using anything other than buckets will result in the player commenting ""i don't think that's going to help just now."" speak to my arm to set sail tokaramja, initiating a cutscene. if you need to bank, this is a good moment. in the cutscene, you'll be talking withcaptain barnaby. if you interrupt him by clicking somewhere else, you will be able to bank very quickly inardougne. talk again with captain barnaby and you will be sailing to karamja. once the ship arrives atbrimhaven, my arm will run off after telling the player that he will meet you attai bwo wannaivillage. players are encouraged to take this opportunity to bank if needed. players may now use thetai bwo wannai teleportto arrive south of where my arm will be found; directly east of thegeneral store. my arm is wandering in a clump of trees. once my arm is located, players will need to talk to him again. after the dialogue sequence with my arm, walk south-east and talk tomurcailywho is the npc running thetai bwo wannai cleanupactivity; he is at the gate to thehardwood grove. he will let you have some hardy gout tubers, but only on the condition that you obtain over 60% favour in the cleanup activity. begin work on the tai bwo wannai cleanup game. for detailed information on this activity, see thisseparate guide. players who have completed some work at this activity will still retain their favour percentage. players may wish to build their favour before beginning to make things move faster. it is possible that during this quest villagers will not trade sticks with you for favour. it is still possible to build up favour and complete the quest, but in order to acquire sticks from the villagers, you may need to complete this quest. once the player has built up 60% favour, they must talk tomurcailyagain. another cutscene will follow in which my arm completely loses patience and causes some minor havoc in the village. murcaily will give as manyhardy gout tubersas he can find in exchange for calming the troll down and escorts him far, far away from the village. when talking to my arm after he terrorises the village, the player will make an amusing comment that they won't let the troll into their house. my arm harassesqutiedollin his quest for goutweed. my arm defeats the village's strongest warrior,jagbakoba, with a hefty punch. my arm demands goutweed from murcaily. after obtaining the tubers, the player needs to talk to my arm again. my arm will suggest that the player take the opportunity to bank and stock up on food because of what he terms ""large birds"" on top of the mountain. when appropriately prepared, return to the roof oftroll strongholdand speak with my arm. the roof is one floor above burntmeat and up the ladder in the room directly to the west of the staircase leading to his kitchen. the player will be asked to provide my arm with the tubers and tools required to plant the herb. the nearbytool leprechaunmay be used to purchase the various tools as they are called for. make sure to buy aspadefrom the tool leprechaun before he evacuates temporarily after the roc appears, a little while after planting the goutweed. the tools my arm asks for are, in order; my arm will probably break the rake during the planting process. if this happens, pick up the pieces of the rake (headandhandle) and reassemble it by using the two pieces on each other, then give him the fixed rake again. the other tools will have no similar complications. if the patch requires curing and you did not bring a plant cure, players may purchase one from the tool leprechaun. after the goutweed is planted, a certain drunken dwarf will appear, before getting unceremoniously hurled off the roof of the stronghold by my arm and eaten by an troll child,drunken dwarf's leg. after the drunken dwarf is eaten, a bird will swoop down and attack. don't panic yet, this is only the first wave, merely a level 56baby rocwhich is fairly easy to defeat. don't waste food or prayer on the baby roc unless actually necessary. you may need to speak with my arm once more before thegiant rocwill appear. when the baby roc dies, the more dangerous level 77giant rocwill attack. the giant roc uses melee and ranged combat styles, and has no weakness. the melee attack will send the player reeling backwards unless the player is already against a barrier. theprotect from missilesprayer is recommended. players with a decent combat level (50+) in their preferred style and good equipment such asrune equipment,mystic equipmentorblue dragonhide armouror better will not have a hard time. the giant roc frequently hits using its wing buffet attack which blows the player across the roof. because of this, you should position yourself with your back to a wall (i.e. the rocks). it hits more accurately than any of the trolls in the stronghold, but slightly slower. if the player is using the melee combat style, they can avoid being tossed around the roof by taking a position where the back of the player is against the rock, cliff, or other barrier while attacking the roc. if this is done successfully, the roc will be unable to blow the player around. if the player chooses to use the magic or ranged combat style options, they can semi-safe spot by hiding behind the herb patch, get near some rocks and useprotect from missilesto reduce damage received as well as avoid being buffeted around entirely. unfortunately, the roc will retreat to just out of range of both bows and spells forcing the player to leave their chosen safe spot in order to continue to attack, at which point the roc will attack as well. the tactic recommended is to dodge the roc's ranged attacks while attacking it with ranged yourself. right before it launches its rock at you, simply step out of the way before it hits you. doing so will limit the amount of damage taken, making the boss fight a little more accessible to ultra-low level players. once thegiant rochas been killed, talk to my arm again. he will ask the player for aspadeso he can harvest thegoutweed. if you forgot to buy a spade from the tool leprechaun earlier, you can return down the ladder then go back up to make him come back. once my arm has harvested the goutweed, he will tell you to talk withburntmeatfor your reward. while my arm is harvesting, he'll exclaim: ""w00t -- farming level!"", although you are the one gaining the experience for his farming efforts, and the usual level-up fireworks will appear above him. return to the kitchen, 2 floors down, and talk to burntmeat. he will give you a ""great"" reward, consisting of a stack of burntmeat's favourite food: burnt meat. talk to him again for a hilarious rant from your player character. return to my arm again to tell him what burntmeat gave you, then you will receive the real quest reward.

(if you try to enter the seventh room directly, the yeti there will still scream and force you back.) now that the ice blocks are in place, follow these steps: then squeeze through the crevice, back into the sixth cavern, but you'll emerge on the upper level. the two blocks you pushed into place close gaps that you could not cross. go east across the platform to the crevice in the eastern wall. south of the crevice are roots that can be cleared during or after the quest with level 80woodcutting, yielding 20,000 woodcutting experience. squeeze through the eastern crevice into the seventh room. players will be on an ice platform north-west of the yeti. study the nearby wall. this unlocks the option to shout into the pipe. shout into the pipe, and the yeti will faint. squeeze back through both crevices and go back to the final room (west, south-east, east). simply walk east into the yeti room. pick up thestones. backtrack through all of the caverns, or alternatively, right click and select the ""exit-cave"" option on the archway in any of the previous rooms. when you head outside the cavern, you will encounter three snow imps:marvin,mariusandbenny. they will reveal that the stones are actually yeti dung, and they planned to prank explorer jack. as you are not nearly as annoying as he was, however, the imps will enchant the ""riches"", turning them intoenchanted stones, and they will now only defrost when given to someone else. head back to explorer jack. choose ""carry on with the imps' prank"" or ""tell the truth about what the stones are"". both choices will yield the same results, eventually; they only affect how the conversation will continue. if you go back to explorer jack after relogging, he will give you 5000 coins: your share of the money from selling the yeti dung to a witch. he also says he's been to the cavern and ""sliding is great fun. you should go back there sometime."" otherwise... congratulations, quest complete! myths of the white lands is not currently required for any quests or miniquests. the etching represents a person crafting various potteries. the etching seems to depict a person climbing a tree. the etching seems to represent a person chopping some reeds with a machete. you study the etching. it seems to indicate that speaking into the tube would amplify your voice."

inside the room, there are several different points of interest that can be investigated. the progress of finding the clues you need are indicated to you as you find them. the room contains strange

all of the souls in the underworld of anyone who has died ongielinor. in an attempt to stop it, icthlarin is trying to shield as many souls as possible. however, icthlarin cannot do enough to stop

fighting for. in order to help her, you will need to recover her memory fragments. head south-west of the lumbridge castle grounds and findwizard grayzag. the following sections are based on which character you have spoken to: confront grayzag on behalf of korasi by stating that he is a mere image of danger and fear in korasi's mind. he will then raise doubt by reminding you of all innocents who died because of the void knight's failure. as korasi, you respond by mentioning all the people than can be saved and are worth fighting for. accepting that truth then causes grayzag image to morph to korasi herself, symbolising her acceptance. you receive thefirst half of her memory. the other half of korasi's memory is being held by an incarnation of jessika, who can be found in the castle's main gate southern tower, on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]. speaking to her will reveal that korasi has not forgotten jessika, and still deeply cares about her. she will then give you thesecond half of korasi's memory. use the two memory halves together, which createsher whole memoryand return to korasi. confront grayzag on behalf of jessika by stating that he is a mere image of danger and fear in jessika's mind. he will then raise doubt by reminding you of all innocents who died because of the void knight's failure. as jessika, you respond by mentioning all the people than can be saved and are worth fighting for. accepting that truth then causes grayzag image to morph to jessika herself, symbolising her acceptance. you receive thefirst half of her memory. the other half of jessika's memory is being held by an incarnation of korasi, who can be found in the castle's main gate southern tower, on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]. speaking to her will reveal that jessika has not forgotten korasi, and still deeply cares about her. she will then give you thesecond half of jessika's memory. use the two memory halves together, which createsher whole memoryand return to jessika. speak to xenia, located inside the dining room of the lumbridge castle (prominently used inrecipe for disaster). she seems to have forgotten her name and the ""stories"" of her adventures. in order to help xenia, you will need to recover memory fragments belonging to her. go upstairs to the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]and attempt to open the chest induke horacio's room. you will be attacked by xenia'sguilt. after you defeat it, pick up theguilt ridden keyit drops, open and search the chest. you will find the first half of xenia's memories. if you attempt to open the chest without the key in your inventory, the guilt will attack again. with the key in your inventory, open the chest to recover the first memory fragment belonging to xenia. go upstairs to the2ndfloor[uk]3rdfloor[us]to where the bank would be and attempt to open the chest. you will be attacked by xenia'sshame. after you defeat it, pick up theshame filled keyit drops, open and search the chest. if you attempt to open the chest without the key in your inventory, shame will attack again. use the two memory halves on each other and talk to xenia again. hazelmere is located on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]of the lumbridge castle. he asks you to find the different instances of him in the world in order to help recover his memories. after talking to him, another instance is located elsewhere on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us], whom you can speak to, allowing hazelmere to start regaining the memories he had previously lost. after you speak to him, he will teleport away, with an energy glob indicating which direction to look for him next. climb the stairs to the2ndfloor[uk]3rdfloor[us], and he'll be on the east side of the ramparts, near the cannons. after speaking with him, he will teleport to the3rdfloor[uk]4thfloor[us](above where the bank would normally be, climb the ladder to the side to reach him). then he'll teleport to the top of the castle gate (go back to where you found jessika/korasi and keep going up the ladders to the2ndfloor[uk]3rdfloor[us]). next he'll teleport behindbob's brilliant axes. he'll then teleport behind the castle. speak with hazelmere again, and he'll teleport to the final location beside astrid/brand. ask him to help you fight nomad, and he will agree. after aiding each recruit, speak to astrid/brand again, and nomad will appear and kill astrid/brand (again). you may then leave through the portal. area of effectabilitieswork well here, as well as various different boosts andprayers. it is recommended to stock up on food, weapons and armour before starting this section. this is not a safe death. if you die, you will be transported to death's office and will either have to buy your items back or fetch them from your gravestone, which will be locatedjust outside the office. recommended items:aggression potion, combat gear, such as magic. familiars are not allowed.ice barrageis highly recommended, but otherbarrage spellswork fine. if you are not quick with abilities,legacy modeis also a huge help, which is especially effective with dual wielding magic weapons that have the highest attack speed. if using dual wielding magic weapons with legacy mode/momentum, remember to set the auto-cast spell to both main hand and off-hand weapon, otherwise you'll just use the main hand, not dealing damage as fast as you could. alternatively you can also set your mode to revolution in theeoc modeso you can automatically use abilities. go northeast to the other dock, which will take you to a new area. the ""embark"" option is difficult to see and is not on the boat; it is a click-space that appears to be on the tiles that are on the dock. low-detail users might experience difficulty when attempting to progress. in this area, there are waves of opponents engagingcave goblins. you must protect the cave goblins by using various different abilities and attacks. three waves must be passed for you to continue the quest, and your progress is saved after each. additionally, if you fail a phase, but you did not die, the goblins will be at ""10/10 goblins"" upon returning. each wave gets progressively more difficult and, if all of the goblins die, you will be transported back to the dock and will have to start that wave over again. you will also not regain any health if you fail to save the goblins. in order to complete this part of the quest, it is recommended to stay in front of the tower where the cave goblins are hiding.  each wave also has a ""final"" unit that signifies the end of that round, so be on the lookout for them when they spawn: each round also has normal and sprinting enemies. normal enemies walk towards the tower while sprinting ones make a dash for it. the sprinting enemies have less health than the normal ones, but should be killed first as they will reach the tower faster. kill enemies as fast as you can, as they will lose interest in you if there are too many enemies attacking you at once. area-of-effect abilities and auto-casts will easily destroy the incoming bandosians while protecting the cave goblins from them. the constitution abilityinciteis also very helpful if you are having trouble keeping the bandosians from killing the cave goblins. if you still have trouble with round 1, 2 or 3, using anaggression potionmight help. once you fend off three rounds of bandosian attacks,zanikwill join your party. after death confirms you've gathered your allies, use the war table to interrogatelegio septimus. in order to do this, you must get ready to manipulate, torture, or charm your way to get enough out of him. septimus has three stats: health, sanity and willpower. they must be decreased by using various interrogation methods to force him to speak, although if you drain his health completely he will die and you will end up having to restart the interrogation. you want to bring his willpower down to 50% and sanity down to 80%, then run through the interrogation topics. if the stats drop too low, legio septimus may not answer the questions, so it is recommended to attempt all the questions frequently. if you stop the interrogation, all your progress is reset and must be done again. septimus will give information when his willpower and sanity are near half drained. once the necessary information has been obtained from septimus, you will be prompted with the option to either kill him or let him go. the order the options are used in can vary their effectiveness (for example: charming at max sanity will have no effect). using the war table, choose two characters and help them collect metal from theunderworld rocksand wood from theunderworld rootto build the battering ram. while collecting metal and wood, nomad will talk directly to you. next, go to the hotspot at the front of the bridge and build the ram. nomad will continue speaking to you as you build the ram. this will give 250constructionexperience 100 times for a total of 25,000 construction experience.bonus experiencewill work here. plan on the war table once more. you will fight large waves of order of ascension and strategically place allies to fend off opposing threats. lead the battering ram to the first gate at icthlarin's fortress. on the way, nomad will taunt you and your makeshift team while ascension members will attack the ram. if you stray too far from the ram, it will stop moving. if the ram is destroyed, you will return to the start. these ascension members do not need 81 slayer to kill, do not use their special abilities and even magic and melee can be used without accuracy penalties. it is still advised to use ranged or magic to clear out large mobs quickly before they can pile damage onto the ram. once the ram reaches the outskirts of the fortress, it will smash the doors and the team will automatically move in. if you were told about the shortcut during the interrogation withlegio septimus, you can skip the second phase of the battering ram fight. otherwise, you will need to continue and escort the battering ram to the portcullis a short distance away. the shortcut is accessible by going into the eastern cave where you gathered metal and wood earlier. on the northern side of this room is a small rock that will have the option to ""use shortcut"". if legio septimus did not tell you about this shortcut, you will not be able to interact with the rock. during the next phase of escorting the ram you will need to face off a large horde of ascension members who will try to attack the ram. ascension members will start spawning in front of you once you proceed a short distance across the bridge. kill them and keep walking the ram towards the doors on the other side of the bridge. once through the doors, take the ram to the portcullis a short distance away. more ascension members will spawn when the ram reaches the portcullis. ascension members spawn from both the sides and behind the ram, so hold them off until the ram breaks the portcullis. one way to protect the ram is by sending death and icthlarin to each side of the ram, and by sending the other four adventurers to the bridge. icthlarin will use a one-hit magic attack, while death will use a one-hit melee attack. death will not automatically attack if he is out of melee range of a target. position him on top of the area where the members spawn to get him to auto attack. another suggestion (requires level 82 herblore) is to use an aggression potion to protect the ram. stand on the edge of the bridge to block off all the ascension members, and place three of your companions on each side of the ram. either withstand or fight the attacks until the ram is finished breaking down the door. once the battering ram successfully batters down the door, the team automatically moves in. zanik, jessika/korasi and hazelmere stay behind to prevent the ascended from getting in and interfering in the fight. you, death, icthlarin and xenia proceed to find the abomination. -the fights involving you and nomad are not safe deaths. in order to bank, quickly log out to the lobby and you will appear outside death's hourglass when you log in.  if you die, your gravestone will appear just outside death's hourglass. the fights where you take control of xenia, death, and icthlarin are safe and you will respawn immediately.- you start each interim fight outside the range ofgielinor'sattacks. to leave, exit through the wall portal behind you. the quest can be continued from death's portal indraynor village. if you are killed by nomad, you will continue at whichever phase you have progressed to, with nomad at full health. after you complete the phases that require the npcs, the player automatically resumes the fight with nomad. you cannot teleport out when fighting nomad, but if you can get out of combat and go to the lobby, you will appear outside death's office. if you happen to die during any nomad phase, the player can restock on supplies. familiars are allowed during the fights with nomad. it might help to turn down your graphics settings for this fight, as it may cause fps (frames per second) issues. it's time to stop the construct. you will fight nomad in four matches (he has 100,000 life points in each phase), with the time between each fight leading an ally against gielinor. to begin, run to the centre bridge to challenge nomad. the fights with nomad and gielinor are not safe deaths; the ones with the allies, however, are safe. tips for the first three phases:  nomad himself uses a typeless attack that cannot be protected against via protection or deflection prayers, but its accuracy is determined by the player's magical defence rating and can be reduced using defensive abilities. bringing a shield as a switch will save the player food. in the first 3 nomad battles, nomad uses gielinor to attack you with 2 different attacks. in the first attack nomad will slam his hand down in the centre of the arena and shadows will appear at your destination. shortly after, gielinor will use a rapid-fire magic attack that deals a constant stream of 850 damage, 450 perhitsplatwith protect/deflect magic. in addition, nomad will say ""feel the power of gielinor!"", teleporting the player to the middle of the bridge. gielinor will then smash its hand at your spot, dealing around 2600-2700 melee damage. this can be avoided by moving away from the centre of the bridge (if using melee,barge,dive, orbladed divecan immediately bring the player into melee distance, otherwisesurgecan reduce damage considerably by moving quickly) or it can be reduced through protect/deflect melee,debilitate(it must hit nomad) ordevotion. resonance can heal from this attack. this attack can easily be avoided when using melee, since your character will automatically run to nomad. once nomad's health is reduced to 0, you take control of xenia. exit through door behind to restock if needed before fighting the ascension. you will not have access to food, prayer, weapons or armour during this battle. however, it is possible to heal xenia (alongside death and icthlarin in their phases) back to full health if theregenerateability is used alongside thepersistent ragerelic. you have only the three specials in the box in the upper part of your window. xenia's responsibility is to clear the ascended creatures at the lower floor before they realise what is going on and assist nomad and the construct. she has three abilities, in addition to her standard magic attack: the arena is a square with ascension members littering three sides of the area. to take out the members quickly and efficiently, run into the centre of the mass on each side, using each ability as soon as it is off cooldown. the capsarii will heal their wounded members now, so get rid of their other members quickly. when xenia attacks a capsarii, half of the damage she inflicts on them will instead heal her. while taking out the members, gielinor will launch red bombs near xenia's location for 1000 damage; run out of the shaded area before it explodes. staying farther away from the centre will give you more time to avoid the red bombs. once all ascension members are killed, xenia's role ends. exit through door to restock if needed. in addition to the first phase attacks, he will now also have access to his soul blast attack fromnomad's requiem. when nomad says ""can you handle my wrath!"", he will teleport to one of the ends of the bridge, charge an attack, and eventually use his soul blast projectile, which will follow and wound you for 7500 life points of typeless damage. the damage from the projectile increases to 9000 if you allowed nomad to take a chunk off the stone of jas during dishonour among thieves. the damage from this attack can be greatly reduced or avoided entirely by hiding behind one of the pillars at the ends of the bridge, which causes nomad to say ""stop hiding you worm"". alternatively, you can bring a shield and use resonance, which blocks (but does not heal from) the full hit. if resonance is on cooldown for whatever reason, debilitate and reflect can reduce the damage by half, with reflect being the preferred option as nomad possesses high defence, making debilitate missing quite likely. once nomad reaches 0 health, you take control of death. if you kill nomad after he orders you to face his wrath, you will still take the full damage from his attack. death's responsibility is to cripple the construct. he has three attacks: stand directly north, west, south, and east of gielinor to provoke the construct, then immediately move a few spaces away. if gielinor's fist smashes death, it can kill him if his life points are low enough and force you to start the phase over again. once gielinor's hand is stuck, go directly on it and use death's scythe to tear out a spirit. immediately claim the released spirit as gielinor will cause the incoming area to become unstable, resulting in rubble from the floor above falling for massive, rapid damage. once four souls have been claimed by death, his role ends. in addition to the previous phases' attacks, nomad will create a clone of himself once he reaches 50,000 life points. if you kill the clone first, you will still need to defeat nomad. if you manage to defeat nomad first instead of the clone, the next phase begins. this is a dangerous phase, as the player effectively takes double damage from the two nomads attacking at once. while the clone is alive, nomad will not teleport you to the centre of the bridge, meaning you can leave through the staircases if you are out of supplies. he will also not use his soul blast attack, although gielinor will still use its area of effect magic attack. if you're having a tough time with taking double damage from both clones, it helps to bring the best shield you can buy and rotateimmortality,debilitate,resonance, andsacrificewhen not on cool-down. cycle withpunishandsliceto build your adrenaline up for the defensive abilities. once nomad reaches 0 health, you take control of icthlarin. as icthlarin, you do not directly attack; instead you walk around, claiming spirits and avoiding the rapidly lethal beam emitted by gielinor.  icthlarin has two abilities: forty-nine spirits are scattered along icthlarin's floor in groups of seven while gielinor attempts to absorb them. gielinor will create an absorption beam to grab nearby souls; icthlarin can claim them by releasing the spirits. if icthlarin is hit by gielinor's beam, he will die and the phase will be restarted.  walk around in a anti-clockwise direction from gielinor's beam, claiming the groups of spirits while as you go.  it is advised to go along the inner area so you will have to click fewer tiles, especially if you are struggling against gielinor's beam.  once all 49 spirits are absorbed by either icthlarin or gielinor, gielinor will unleash a powerful attack on you.  when prompted, use his shield to block and reflect his attack.  if you managed to get all 49 spirits in one go, the next phase will begin automatically as all damage is reflected back at it. it may take more than one round, but once enough damage and spirits are absorbed, icthlarin's role ends. the final phase consists of nomad using only very rapid but inaccurate melee attacks, which deal up to 3000 damage each. use protect/deflect melee as nomad can hit rather hard and fast during this phase. he will not use any more moves from his previous phases, but gielinor will still use its magic attack. stay on the bridge so you know when gielinor will use his rapid-fire attack. if you struggle to defeat nomad,resonance,debilitate,reflectanddevotioncan reduce the damage of his attacks. once nomad reaches 0 health, both of you are teleported to the centre of the bridge where nomad collapses. if the cutscene does not occur, click on nomad to start it. the player can choose to have either death or icthlarin kill gielinor. sliske will arrive and invite the player, along with gielinor's killer (as he views the construct as a god). you are given an option to let nomad live or die; regardless of your choice, sliske will bring nomad along with him, angering both death and icthlarin. once the dialogue is over, you may optionally speak with your allies before speaking with death. before leaving, icthlarin will say that because zanik was forcefully taken from the world due to bandos' actions, he offers you the choice of allowing her a short reprieve as the soul obelisk caretaker due to zimberfizz's death. if you accept, icthlarin will allow zanik to stay in gielinor for a few years as the caretaker of the soul obelisk and assoul warshost, whilezimberfizz's remainsare removed from the site. if you refuse, his ashes remain as the soul wars host. nomad lies defeated. sliske appears and offers an invitation to the player and either icthlarin or death. sliske takes nomad away. nomad's elegy is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: concept art of nomad with some other characters. concept art of nomad's ""throne room"" from developer

(if you move the pillars before directing water to this room, the pillars reset when you leave the room, but not when climbing the ladders.) the pattern found on the top of each pillar shows which water channels are opened. beware of the aggressivespectral attendantsin this room. note that any defeated attendants will not respawn until/unless the player logs off. go up the ladder in the south-east part of the room and pull both levers. go up another ladder in the north-east part of the room and push both pillars so that they cover the drains. go down to the middle floor and check that water is flowing to the southern channel in the room. if it is not, work the levers until it is. return to the bottom room to begin the puzzle. the aim of the puzzle is to have all three streams at the northern end (flowing into the machine) activated. there may be other ways to solve the waterflow problem, but if you put all the ""+"" pillars in the three spots near the machine, you will have an easier time solving the puzzle. a possible solution is as follows: when you get the ""yes, the device looks to be out of order now"" message in the chatbox, then you have disabled the device. if you do not see such a message, you can still tell if the device is disabled if it says ""broken device"" instead of ""strange device"". go back up one floor and mine the rubble next to the eastern channel. pull the southern lever until it changes the water flow to the east channel. this will cause a waterfall to form in the south-eastern room; it is no longer needed in the south-western room because the machine is broken. leave the water channel rooms and head to the south-eastern room. get several pieces ofelemental fuelout of the fuel hopper. if you do not have room, bank your food - it is not needed here. leave a trail of fuel on the floor (""place elemental fuel"") to lure threeelemental creaturesout of the device in the room and onto the water flowing out of the ceiling, which destroy the creatures. if water was not sent to this room, the waterfall will be too weak to kill the elemental, and will instead cause the elemental to return back to the device. only one creature can be lured at time. there seems to be no limit to the distance the creatures can move between pieces of fuel as long as it is a straight line view. you can lure each creature using only two pieces of fuel by placing the first alongside the wall north of the waterfall and the second inside the waterfall. if a creature eats a piece of fuel before the next piece is placed, you have only 2–3 seconds to place the fuel before the creature gives up and returns to the device. in this case, you must begin again with another creature. you need to lure 3 creatures into the waterfall before the machine shuts off. exit the elemental creature room and go north through the arcane doorway. in this new room, there is a second arcane doorway to the north, again protected by two power cables that must be turned off. beware of the aggressivespectral worshippersin this area. go west and go through a door in the west wall. go west down a corridor until you come to the first room. a set of animated roots guard the power device, preventing you from getting to it. if you try to attack the roots, you discover that they are unassailable when bunched like this. you must find a way to unbunch them. continue west following the vines on the floor. beware of the aggressivespectral cultivators. in four places, find and destroy the individual roots that stick up from the ground. you hear a loud roar when you destroy the fourth root. return to the room with the power device, where a level 98decaying avatarwill have spawned. when fighting the avatar, it will try to heal using roots that grow from the floor during the battle. destroy the root before it can eat it; if it eats a root, it heals to full health, prolonging the battle. a root appears when the avatar has 75%, 50%, and 25% of its health left, in the following order: nw, se, and ne of the room. don't worry too much if the avatar does get to the roots, as after the third root, no more appear. the avatar can be safe-spotted from the hallway. otherwise, try to position yourself in between the area the root will appear and the avatar when fighting him. this way you have a good chance to melee the root and destroy it before the avatar gets to it. when the avatar is killed, the waving roots disappear and the power device is automatically damaged. players with higher combat levels shouldn't have too much trouble with the avatar, although it's advised to still come prepared. if you leave the fight before killing the avatar (for example, by teleporting out of the temple), you will have to start the fight from the beginning again, but you won't have to destroy the four roots to get the avatar to appear. however, if you log out of the game, it resets and you have to destroy all the roots again to face the avatar. note that unlike the fight with nomad, this is anunsafedeath. if you die while fighting the decaying avatar, your gravestone can be found in the soul wars waiting area. return to the arcane door area and go east. at the doorway in the east wall, talk to thedying knightand then search his body when he dies. he will explain that he set up some explosives to help you destroy the machine. you get a clue about being pious, which means thepietyprayer will help you in the next room, so high prayer boosting gear is recommended. if you are not on the standard prayer book, restore potions can also be used to counteract the effect of the haze. turn on piety and enter the east room. without piety activated, the haze in the east room drains ten life points, as well as prayer and other stats every tick. you may want to change yourgraphics settingsto low detail, as it can be difficult to see in high detail. the western part of the room contains several aggressivecorruption beasts, andprotect from meleewill help reduce the damage from their attacks. if you run low on prayer points, killing a corruption beast ""uplifts your spirit"" and fully recharges your prayer points. collect the fivestone slabsfrom piles of rock scattered throughout the room and build a bridge across the central pool, at the point where two slabs are already in the pool. jump to the furthest slab, then left-click (""place slab"") on the slabs in your inventory. when the bridge is built, cross to the eastern part of the room. equip your magic weapon and ignite the explosive barrels to detonate them and destroy the machine. you must have runes for a fire spell in order to ignite the barrels;

if you die, you respawn next tozimberfizzat the entrance tosoul warswith all your items.(despite the lead-up to the battle, it will not be terribly difficult for higher-levelled players. if you really struggle,deathtouched dartsdo work.) nomad's basic attack is an at-range magic attack that is capable of hitting over 2500. it deals typeless damage, which means thatprotect from magicanddeflect magichave no effect whatsoever on it. however, your magic defence does affect the attack's accuracy; for this reason, armour with high magic defence is strongly recommended when fighting him. for a more in-depth guide, see nomad'sstrategies page. be careful not to remain hidden from nomad for too long. a few seconds after he says ""face me!"" he will call you a coward, teleport to his throne and heal back to full health. the boss fight may also reset entirely. the first time nomad is reduced to 25% of his maximum life points, he will heal himself back to full health. the second time, however, nomad will go berserk and switch to a melee attack with his staff. although he will not use any of his other attacks when he goes berserk, his melee attack will hit very rapidly (once every 2 ticks), and it can deal 500+ damage.protect from meleeanddeflect meleeappear to have some effect against his melee attack. kill nomad, who says you have doomed the world upon his death, and leave the temple. if you happen to die at the same time as nomad, it will still count as a success. you will appear outside nomad's tent. talk tozimberfizzand tell him nomad is dead. he will not believe it and follow you to his body. you will even kick the head to make sure he is dead. zimberfizz is content, puts on a new outfit and the two of you leave. however, as you walk out, nomad stands up and teleports away. showing zimberfizz nomad's body. zimberfizz gains some new attire, and explains his plans for soul wars. nomad gets up and teleports away to receive the soul wars cape, speak to zimberfizz again, opt 1 talk about nomad's requiem, opt 1 can we talk about my own soul wars cape? he will ask you, red or blue? now repeat this chat with zimberfizz and ask to swap the color of the cape for the varrock achievement. nomad's requiem is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: mod markhad originally stated that nomad's requiem would not have a sequel and the purpose of the quest was purely to have a very hard boss fight.[source needed]however, nomad's story was continued in thesixth agequestdishonour among thievesthat had him teaming up with the player,zamorak, and a number of other devout zamorakians to attempt to steal thestone of jasfromsliske. nomad's requiem received a direct sequel on15 february2016withnomad's elegy, which again features nomad planning to siphon souls, albeit on a larger scale. nomad's powerful throne "

help him find it and make sure his family do not find out about his failure. talk toolaf hradson, who is north-east of rellekka at the eastern rock crab spot, just west of fairy ringdks, and he will tell you about his attempt to live up to his family's reputation by becoming an expert explorer. although he failed miserably, he wants to liven up his family's spirits and asks you to deliver some special carvings to them. unfortunately, he only has damp wood on him, so he directs you to thewindswept treeup the mountain path to the east, from which you could obtain some dry wood. go up the hill and cut the windswept tree with any axe to getwindswept logs. if snowflakes are falling at your screen, you're on the right path. once you bring the logs back, olaf will make abowlfor you to take to his wife and aplankto give his son back in rellekka. olaf hradson's wife,ingrid hradson, is found wandering around the well, just south-east of the long hall inrellekka. after you give her the bowl, ingrid will give you a loaf ofbreadin return for your troubles. olaf's son,volf olafson, is further north by the helmet shop. after you tell him that his father has sent him a gift from a far-away exotic land, he exchanges the plank for a cookedshark. go back to olaf hradson and you notice that the fire that he had made to keep himself warm, has burned out and he is shivering in the cold. talk to him and he will hand you some damp wood and request you to light a fire. use thedamp planksand atinderboxon the firepit and talk to him again. after deciding whether or not to give him the food (he will only take the first piece of food in your inventory), he will give yousven's last map. the x on the map is coincidentally right next to the windswept tree that you visited earlier. be aware that, if dialogue is ended between feeding olaf and receiving the map, such as by being attacked by a nearbyrock crab, you will have to restart the dialogue and feed olaf again. now is the time to get your armour and supplies to deal with a level 49 monster. dig beside the windswept tree and prepare to fall into thebrine rat cavern. head east through the cave. after coming across a fork in the path, take the east path. make sure to kill askeleton fremennikalong the way, and obtain akey(note that the key does not show up on the loot screen). continue along the east path to a wall. the picture wall requires a puzzle to be solved in order to unlock. the puzzle is quite simple: rotate the pieces to create a skull. the four levers each control two bone pieces. when finished, ""pull"" the ""confirm"" lever on the bottom-right. search the wall again to go through it. if the skull is not in the right position when clicking ""confirm"", a rock will swing out of the wall, causing 30 damage. you do not need to re-solve the puzzle if you exit the dungeon from this point onward. after crossing into the larger room to the north, you will find somerope, rotten barrels, and several skeleton fremennik. take two barrels and six ropes from the piles around the room. with these supplies, head to the northeast corner of the room, where there will be a rickety-looking bridge. make sure to turnrunoff to walk, otherwise you will slip and be placed back inside the cavern. use a barrel on the empty parts of the walkway to get across (the surge or escape abilities cannot be used here). repeat this step on the next empty spot. if you fail to cross the bridge after you repair it, you will not need to repair it again. the gate in the middle of the walkway has a lock — it must be matched with the key handle you obtained from killing the skeleton, as there will be 6 different types of key handles. click on the correct shape to open the door — the key will disappear. askeleton fremennikcan be killed to receive another key if necessary. if you fall off after you unlock the door, you must get another key, as the door won't stay unlocked. to commence the fight, attempt to open the chest in the middle of the old longboat-wreck. a level 49skeleton fremenniknamedulfricwill appear. he uses melee, soprotect from meleeis highly effective in order to block most of ulfric's attacks; alternatively use the safe spot at the grave where he appears to range or mage him. there are also some good spots to use ahalberdsuccessfully. his low hitting and inaccurate attacks make this an easy boss fight. ulfric will teleport if you end up on one side of the longboat wreck with him on the other side. he will yell ""no escape, outlander!"" when he teleports. after killing ulfric, open the chest again with 5 empty inventory slots, and the quest will be completed. olaf's quest is not currently required for any quests or miniquests."

enter and tell you about theabbey of saint elspeth. as you enter the abbey, you will hear a group of troubadours singing, and see one of the sisters waiting for you. speak tosister catherina, who will tell you thatabbess benitahas asked her to wait for an adventurer to arrive, although she doesn't know why. she will tell you to immediately head for benita's office, which is located inside of citharede abbey, the second room towards the north. abbess benita wants you to investigate the murder of one of their sisters, which she had not yet told the others about. she says that the last time she sawsister annawas at vespers the day before, and found her body when she didn't turn up for compline. she hands over akey to sister anna's cell, so that her private room can be investigated. she also wants sister anna's body to be inspected, and for the people around the abbey to be questioned. abbess benita will also request you to be subtle in your investigations as she doesn't want the murder to be known. she will give you anotebookto keep track of progress with the investigation. this can be useful if missing a clue, since lines of investigation are crossed out if all the clues involved with them are found. sister anna's cell is in the south-east corner of the abbey with the rest of the cells. read the doors to find the correct one and open it with the key. here, inspect the bed to find acloth fragment, and the window to reveal it was broken from inside. in the north western part of the abbey is the applicants room, in which you will find anothercloth fragmenton the bed. sister anna's body is in the infirmary, in the south-west corner of the abbey. the abbess prepared it for burial herself and forbade the other sisters from seeing it. investigate the body simply by clicking on the bed covered with grey blanket. the information about sister anna's body and her wounds will be revealed. the body will give up to four clues. a total of five people found in and around the monastery will need to be questioned. the order in which you speak to them does not matter. when you have spoken to the suspects correctly, you will be notified that you have gathered clues that will appear in the chat box in red text. make sure you get all the clues to continue. all of the questions must be asked of each suspect. valerio and sister catherina both ask you why are you asking such questions. telling them the truth or following abbess benita's orders won't change the outcome of the quest. run through all the options when speaking to each suspect, to avoid missing the clues, resulting in failing to continue the quest. sister debora (called ""feet"" when first encountered), who can be found upstairs in the clock tower in the north-east corner, confuses the adventurer with sister catherina and asks for help with setting up the correct time on the clock. she says how the clock is incorrect, which can be fixed by rotating the hands. set them to the 12 o'clock position. as soon as it is fixed she will come out of the clock and you may now question her. return to abbess benita and say that you are finished. if clues are missing, she will say how many have yet to be found. once all the clues are found, say who you think is the killer. the option chosen doesn't matter since the result will be the same. a cut-scene occurs and a scream will be heard. follow the sound of the scream to the cellar. the door to the kitchen has been blocked, so players will need to go via the chapel to get there. go down the stairs, and you'll find sister elena's corpse, along with sister cecilia panicking. abbess benita will then say that she cannot hide this any longer, and will ask for you to find the clues. first, investigate both the bloodstains and the body. do not search the reliquary (providing that it is open). if you choose yes and are not wearing anything saradomin related, you will get hit for your current life points minus one. once all the clues related to sister elena's murder are found, return to benita to submit what you have found and she will ask who killed sister elena. again, the option chosen does not matter. she then asks the adventurer to bring sister catherina back inside for her own safety. go outside and talk to sister catherina, who is dancing with the troubadours. you must respond to her request to dance with her (agreeing or refusing to) before asking her to come back into the abbey. once you have, pick the first option to take her back inside (will not work if you have not found all previous clues). she agrees to go back in, but another cut-scene occurs. as the player passes through the gateway, the gate comes down and sister catherina is locked outside. the player may only watch as ""the ripper"" jumps down and murders sister catherina in cold blood. valerio rushes to try to save her, interrupting the masked killer, but is too late. climb the ladder to the south of the portcullis and operate the winch to open it. investigate the body or talk to valerio. abbess benita also appears, and after a brief conversation. walk to abbess benita's office. in the office, again, choose an option for who you think is the murderer, but it again does not matter. in further conversation, suggest making a trap to catch the masked killer. suggest a new victim/target as a bait for the masked killer. then you need to choose ""they were all associated with valerio"". after the conversation, pick up a cabbage from the small field just south of the kitchen, and then head downstairs to the cellar. move the nearbycandelabrumor tri-candle stand next to thereliquary. the candelabrum can be difficult to see in low detail. taking care to not accidentally select eat, put the cabbage on it. more could be picked from the centre of the abbey. search the robe cabinet for a set ofcitharede robes, put them on the candelabrum to finish off sister cabbage and hide in the cabinet. another cut-scene will play wherethe killerarrives and attacks thedummy. exit the cabinet and try to knock the killer out. however, the killer is not knocked out and runs away up the stairs. chase it around the abbey. small cut-scenes will play to show where the masked killer is running. it heads to the kitchen, then outside to the gate which is closed. two of valerio's group block the gate, making the ripper run to the prayer area. the sisters don't notice, however, and the masked killer runs up to the clock tower. once at the clock tower, the masked killer takes sister debora as a hostage and it is revealed that the masked killer wassister annaherself. you cannot fight her, however, only have a conversation with her. she believes she is the spirit of saint elspeth and thatsaradominwished the dancers, the singers, and the musicians to die. she explains that she killed all the sisters in cold blood because of their lust to dance, which she finds evil in her possessed mind. she killed the abbey applicant,isabella, and dressed her in abbey robes to look like sister anna's body. there is no way to convince her to release sister debora and surrender. to stop her, go down one floor and operate the clock mechanism, setting the time to twelve o'clock, where the both hands hits the topmost notch. contrary to most clocks the thin hand is the hour hand and the thick hand is the minute hand. return and talk to sister anna again. in order for the bell to ring, you will have to select the option that refers to a bell while talking to sister anna. this will result in the bell ringing, causing her to cower due to the noise. sister debora pulls off sister anna's claws, throwing them off of the tower. talk to sister debora and she will leave. you must talk to sister debora first or sister anna will ignore you. sister anna will break from her madness, her regret, and her actions. three options will appear as you talk to sister anna. however, choosing any of them results in sister anna falling off the tower to her death, either by her own delusional choice, or by your own choice; the choice will not affect the outcome, or the rewards of the quest. after the cut-scene you are returned to abbess benita's office, where you have two choices: you can either reveal sister anna as the true culprit, much to the horror of the abbess and valerio, who will indicate that both her resignation and the possible disintegration of the order may result. the second choice is to reveal that the ripper demon who possessed her as the offender. regardless of your choice, abbess benita will thank and reward you.  congratulations, quest complete! the below activities are members-only: one piercing note is not currently required for any quests or miniquests. in the lead-up to the

remote desert plateau and set up an abbey in her memory. within the abbey’s sand-blasted walls the sisters of saint elspeth devote their lives to prayer and sacred music. now there has been a murder

her apprentice,jimmy the chisel, has gone missing while gathering supplies. he was last seen between draynor village and lumbridge, 'near the old mine'. head to thehamheadquarters north-east fromlumbridgeand across theriver lum, open the old mine entrance, and climb down. go to the south-east corner to find jimmy in a small jail. after speaking to him, you will need to go to the southern-most room and speak tojohanhus ulsbrecht, the h.a.m leader, about jimmy's release; he will let jimmy go if you can provide his cult with a month's supply of chickens from jimmy's brother,fred the farmer. exit the ham headquarters and head over the bridge and north-west tofred'sfarm on the western side oflumbridge. he does not have enough chickens, butseth groats, the owner of the farmhouse on the other side of the river, does. across the river lum, speak withseth groats. he is ready to help, but he requires somechicken cages. he suggests talking tohorvik, the varrock smith, along with 3steel barsas debt from a previous job. with the steel bars, go talk tohorvikinvarrock; he owns the platebody shop there. unfortunately, he is very ill and needs aherbal antidote, and fivepigeon cagesto modify into chicken cages. he tells you to go toardougneto get the pigeon cages. for the antidote, go to theapothecaryinvarrock. he gladly agrees to help you, favour-free, but as he is giving you thebreathing salts, he drops the pot. since the salts cannot be stored in a non-airtight container, he will ask you to get him a newairtight pot. while you can make a pot right then and there, or purchase one from the grand exchange, the apothecary will not accept it untilaftercompleting all of the subsequent favours. go tobarbarian villageand talk totassie slipcastthe potter, as suggested by the apothecary. she is too upset to show you how to make an airtight pot, since she is being pressured byhammerspike stoutbeard, a dwarf from whom she took a loan and who is now unfairly increasing the interest on it. enter thedwarven minesfrom the northern entrance (north-east of thefalador lodestone). go south, and then west when you see the anvils. keep going west until you seehammerspike stoutbeardsurrounded by somedwarf gang members. ask him abouttassie slipcastand his choice of profession; he actually always wanted to be a druid. he'll relieve tassie of her grief if you can help him become a druid initiate. if you have not completed the new version of thedruidic ritualquest, you must speak with sanfew first to complete the updated version before continuing. go totaverleyand speak withsanfew; he is in the house just west of thepet shop (taverley). sanfew will allow hammerspike to become his apprentice, in exchange for two favours: he wants you to give aguthix rest potiontocaptain bleemadgeon top ofwhite wolf mountainand convince him to take sanfew down to thefeldip hills, so that he can spread awareness aboutguthixamongst the inhabitants. make aguthix restpotion: add aclean harralanderto avial of water, and then add theclean marrentill. the herbs must be added in this specific order only, as any other way does not concoct a restful potion. travel to the top ofwhite wolf mountainand present the potion tocaptain bleemadge. there is an aggressive level 43big wolfnear him, so be wary; there is a tree nearby that you can lure him behind. alternatively, you can take a gnome glider straight to him. feeling refreshed, he agrees to take sanfew into ogre territory, although he needs some special, lightweight ropes known as t.r.a.s.h. (triple redundant aero super hawsers) for the trip down to thefeldip hills. travel tocatherbyand speak toarhein, the general store manager on the docks. he says that he himself designed t.r.a.s.h and is willing to barter it for aweather reportto protect his cargo from bad weather. go toseers' villageand talk tophantuwti fanstuwi farsightin the house south-east of the lodestone, also marked by a lantern on the wall beside the door. he is busy looking for a girl namedpetraand will not perform the weather forecast until she is found. he points in a vague direction about petra's whereabouts – in a nearby cave, to the south-west of the village. travel to thegoblin cavejust east of thefishing guild. inside the cave, follow the east wall until you come to a cavern. as you enter the cavern a cut-scene pans the camera to a distorted rock in the wall – an impression of a woman, possibly petra.searchthe sculpture, and you find a message telling you to speak towizard cromperty. before you go talk to cromperty, pick up fivepigeon cagesfrom behind the house situated just south of the northern ardougne bank, if you haven't already. cromperty can be found in north-eastardougne; his house has a blue-checked floor, also indicated in the mini-map. he explains that the girl was another of the adventurers on whom he experimented his teleport spells, but he couldn't track her down. he can free the girl with someiron oxide, but he needs your assistance in getting some from the antique merchant inport khazard. go toport khazardand talk totindel marchant– he is on the pier south of thefishing trawler. he promises to hand you some rust if you could, unsurprisingly, get hisstodgy mattressstuffed byrantzand spare him the insomnia. go to thefeldip hills(quick access available by using fairy ring codeaks, then heading east) and talk torantzon the eastern side of the hills. he cannot do it because of the loud disturbance caused by a small man, which is scaring the chompy birds away. go west until you see agnome glider(or as rantz calls it, a 'flapper') beside a gnome namedgnormadium avlafrim. beware an aggressive level 67 ogre nearby - you can get him stuck to the north of the lights. talk to him and he will tell you he needs to repair the landing strip for a new glider route. search each landing light for a gem, cut it, and put it back in their respective positions (from west to east is sapphire, opal, red topaz, jade). be sure to use the gems with thegnomelanding lights, as using them with the landing lights gives the message ""nothing interesting happens."" the gnome can sell you achiselat 10 coins and sparegemsat 500 coins each if you happen to crush them (you might want to bring some jade, opal and red topaz with you, but it is not necessary). once you repair the strip, talk to the gnome again; he will start up the lights on the runway. go back to rantz on the eastern side of feldip hills, who stuffs the mattress with feathers and gives you acomfy mattress. take the mattress totindelinport khazard(south ofdjp), for someiron oxide. take the iron oxide towizard crompertyinardougne; he will give you ananimate rock scroll. take some armour and a weapon and travel back to thegoblin cavenear thefishing guild. inside the east cavern, cast the spell (""um nahi listic durooo-rah!"") near petra. you will mis-hit and accidentally animate another rock, causing a level 63slagilithto appear. if you exit the room or are in combat for too long, a message will appear saying that the slagilith is bored fighting you and it'll return into a rock form, forcing you to fight it all over again. when you defeat the slagilith, it drops anuncut ruby, anuncut diamond, and anadamantite stone spirit. cast the spell again and petra will be freed. fighting the slagilith. cast the spell a second time to free petra. travel back toseers' villageand speak tophantuwti. go through the various options one by one until you see the option that discusses 'tools', and 'what combination of items' is necessary for the repair. he finally confesses that his weather vane is broken, and give you permission to go up on the roof to fix it. access the roof via the ladder, in the building with the spinning wheel, to the east. climb up to the roof of his house and search the weather vane, then select the 'hammer' option and finally search again to get threebroken vane parts. go to an anvil with abronze bar, aniron barand asteel barand use the parts of the weather vane with the anvil (the nearest anvil is located west of the seers' village bank). back on the roof, put theweathervane pillar, thedirectionalsand theornamentback. talk tophantuwtiagain and he will give you a rather humorousweather report. take the report toarheinincatherby. he tells you that his ingenious t.r.a.s.h. has been already delivered tocaptain bleemadge. talk tocaptain bleemadgeon top ofwhite wolf mountain, who says he's now ready to fly off with sanfew. deliver the latest news tosanfew, who agrees to let a dwarf become his initiate. talk tohammerspike stoutbeardin thedwarven mines. apparently, he has changed his mind and wants to keep being a gangster, not sparing tassie. when you threaten him, hisdwarven gang memberswill attack you; do not kill them before the conversation, because hammerspike will simply summon three more to attack. this fight is multi-combat and all three will attack at once. defeat them and he will agree to stop harassing tassie. travel togunnarsgrunnand talk totassie. for being a good samaritan, she teaches you how to makepot lids– just use the wheel to make an unfired pot lid. fire the pot lid in the pottery oven, and then use it on a pot to get an airtight pot. tassie will provide you with one workable piece ofclay. bring the airtight pot to the apothecary invarrockto obtain some breathing salts. go tohorvik, who can be found athis armour shopinvarrock, and give him the herbal tincture,breathing saltsand fivepigeon cagesto get somechicken cages. deliver the chicken cages toseth groatsin the farm inlumbridge. inform johanhus, in theham headquarters, about his renewed food supply and keeping his side of the deal, he releases jimmy. go todraynor villageand speak withaggiethe witch, who agrees to be a character witness for brian's friend. as a token of thanks,brianofport sarimreturns your favour and hands you asharpened hatchet. go back to any of thejungle foresterssouth ofshilo villageand they will give you somered mahogany logsin exchange for the sharpened hatchet. finally, speak with yanni in shilo village to hand over his red mahogany logs. when he responds with just a ""thanks"", you obviously get upset. summarising your journey halfway across the world and then some more, yanni agrees to reward you with some of his antiques. congratulations, quest complete! the following can be unlocked in the lands you venture into if you have not visited them beforehand, but there is no unique music for this quest: one small favour is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: jimmy the chisel in the h.a.m jail fixing the weather vane"

mordautand the uncovering ofrobert the strong's lost library. it is notable for having significant quest requirements, being less straightforward than the quests preceding it, and featuring lots of travelling, characteristics which saw a decline throughout2012and2013.[1]in the final quarter of 2013, mod raven created several threads on theforums, asking about people's views on quest requirements and which elements ofwhile guthix sleepspeople most enjoyed, which were subsequently incorporated into one of a kind.[2][3] speak tomr mordautathis officein thevarrock museum, accessed by opening the door directly at the back of the stairs on the bottom level of the museum which can be accessed by going down the stairs found on the main floor. he says that he is researching the history of thedragonsand has uncovered the final journal ofhannibus, thedragon rider. this journal may give information about the current location of hannibus and suggests reading it if you accept the quest. he gives you thejournal, in which hannibus describes how he has been hunted byenakhra, who was collecting petrified trophies forzamorak. hannibus had been hiding in a cave but then decided to travel far away to throw enakhra off his scent, leaving his dragon behind. after reading it, speak to mordaut again. mordaut believes that enakhra was able to curse hannibus, turning him into a statue, but that enakhra was never able to deliver it to zamorak. he also says that, during research into the dragonkin, he discovered thatrobert the stronghad found a strange, lifelike statue and taken it to his library to study and he believes this to be hannibus. unfortunately, the location of the library has been lost. suggest to mordaut thatbob the catmight know something, as he is the reincarnation of robert the strong, and he will agree and tell you to go and speak to bob. use yourenchanted catspeak amulet(orcramulet) to locate bob, who wanders all overgielinor. a good place to start looking for bob is in burthorpe, as that's where he spawns after every game update. once you have found bob, he will tell you that he doesn't remember anything about his former life, but when he first saw the house just west ofgaius's two-handed shopin burthorpe, he was instantly attracted to it, and thus adopted the human living there,unferth. go to bob's house just south-east ofburthorpe castleand speak to unferth. he will not know of any libraries, only repeatedly insisting that he does not own any ogre romance novels. ask him if you can search for the hidden library and he will remark that bob was always particularly drawn to the ground floor. proceed with your investigation, smashing the bookcase, spreading soot from the fireplace and devastating the table in the process. he will angrily remark that you are probably going to tear up his carpet next. remove the rug to reveal ahidden trapdoor, to unferth's shock; enter it to find yourself in the library of robert the strong. once in the library, you will find dozens of bookcases, shelves with scrolls, armour stands and weapon racks, loose papers, locked chests and several dragonkin artefacts frombrimhaven dungeonandkethsi. there is also a pet basket forodysseusand a blackboard with amapof dragonkin locations. one bookcase contains a book about robert's youth onteragard, the originalhumanrealm, and how he broke into the church where theschism, the source of the planet's power, was held and was transported to another dimension. near the blackboard is a large stonestatueof a reptilian creature holding a lance. next, search robert's desk in the middle. this will reveal a book on making aanimate rock scroll, which could animate the statue. robert remarks in it that he figured out one item to be anemerald(anuncut emeraldwill also work), but had to go to aseerfor the other one. the seer responded with a riddle: the solution to the riddle is ""rust"", which affects metal items although it needs time to appear. searching theweapon racknear the stairs allows you to scrape someiron oxideinto a bottle. search the desk while holding an emerald along with the iron oxide and choose to create an animate rock scroll. read the scroll while standing beside the statue in the southern part of the room, and you will animate the statue ofhannibus, the lastdragon rider. speak with hannibus and inform him it is thesixth age. he is in an emotional state, having been released after millennia of conscious petrification and the loss of his kinsmen. he will tell you about how he and his kin left their homeworld to follow the ""empty lord""zaros, who promised a way to solve their problem of declining population, and how they became riders of dragons in his armies instead. he will also tell you about theolun'dai, the predestined fate hannibus and the otherilujankabelieve to be part of. eventually you will decide that he needs a way to return home and suggest to search the library for clues. search the bookcases on the east and west side of the library. after searching the eastern one, you'll receive aprimer on dragonkin language. it contains translations of a couple of words from the dragonkin language, including their names for several geographical locations, as well as an explanation of how their simple grammatical syntax works. search the western bookcase to find a book titled ""flight of the dragonkin"", which features robert wishing he could talk to the ""enormous statues with stone eyes gazing out across the world"" in order to learn more about the dragonkin. the first page of the dragonkin primer contains some text in the dragonkin language. you can either translate the words using the list on the following pages, or toggle the automatic translation option. now read the map behind hannibus to update your knowledge of dragonkin language with place names if you hadn't already. you must now either follow the lead in the dragonkin primer, or locate the mysterious stone statues around the world. these can be done in any order, but it is recommended to do the latter first. whichever task you finish first will eventually end up in hannibus declaring that lead a dead end. to follow the lead in the book in robert's library, you must find severalmysterious statuesscattered around the world. you must seek out at least two of the four statues, which are located near theseers' villagebank, outside thetower of life(djpor kandarin monastery reached by using thekandarin monastery teleport), near thefishing guildentrance, and near the karamja lodestone. after finding one, you must find a way to speak to it. do this by enchanting it with your animate rock scroll. it will ask if you are adragonkinor atokhaar. you can say you are one of the two or reveal that you are a human, to which the statue will reply that humans destroyed many of their kind, all built by the tokhaar eons ago, to use as building material for their castles. they will also tell you that they had been positioned in a circle to all gaze in the direction of something called the sleeper, but that a group ofknightshad rotated the statues to point to theirholy grail. it will then ask you to rotate it to face the correct location; comply with this. visit all statues and rotate them. you only need to speak to and turn two, but rotating all four rewards the player with 10,000 bonus experience in any skill or 5,000 experience in any elite skill and is a requirement for themaster quest cape. now you must follow the directions they face in order to locate the 'sleeper'. by intersecting the statues' views, you will note that it is located onentrana, so bank any items with stats and travel there. in the far north-west corner of entrana the top of a submerged statue can be seen off the coast. use your animate rock scroll anywhere near there to bring the sleeper to life and to summon hannibus. the sleeper will warn of the dragonkin's wrath if the tools of the creators (the stone of jas) is used. additionally, it will remark of a time when younger so-called gods came and that a certaingodignored the warnings not to use theelder artefacts(which would invoke the kin's wrath), submerged the sleeper beneath the waves so the others would not hear, and turned the siblings of the circle away from the sleeper. for many ages, the sleeper had only one visitor who was like a dragonkin but not characteristic of that race and peaceful of nature. it asked the sleeper obscure questions about the curse that affects the dragonkin, the curse ofjas. when asked about travelling between dimensions to get hannibus home, the sleeper will remark that the dragonkin can travel to thestone of jasif it is abused regardless of its location, and only one type ofdragonis known to be able to do this. the sleeper then seems to remember seeing one other creature with the power to pass planar barriers, who flew high above the sleeper and vanished through a hole in the sky. if you did this task before investigating the language, hannibus will tell you this is a dead end, and to investigate the lead given by the primer. the first sentence in the primer, noted there by robert, is ""kletter draekeun dosk arraken ullergrax."" using the primer, this can be partially translated to ""kletter dragon dosk dungeon forinthry."" robert also remarks that dragons are written as ""colour/type - dragon - title"" in dragonkin language. you will have to find dragons in a dungeon in thewilderness. they cannot be black dragons, otherwise the adjective would have been ""kreath"". therefore, the phrase refers to thegreen dragonsin theforinthry dungeon. ensure that you are not opted in topvpcombat in thewildernessby talking tovalain edgeville and make your way to the dungeon, the entrance of which is in level 17 of the wilderness. you will need to ascend deeper into level 22 of the wilderness while in the dungeon. the dungeon is west of the wilderness lodestone. thewilderness sword 2or higher provides free teleports to the dungeon entrance. as you approach the green dragons east of where you entered the dungeon, a cutscene ensues where hannibus approaches, calms and bonds with a green dragon. the dragon tells hannibus that he does not know of any dragons with the abilities described by the sleeper, but that thecreatorsdid occasionally pay them visits. they would conduct experiments on the dragon before leaving notes in the rocks for future dragonkin to visit. search the cave for such a text. it can be found on a rock south-east of the dragon; as you approach it, it will begin to glow. you will automatically transcribe it in your primer. the second clue is: ""kletter draekeun tescan kath. draekeun castil lokur kel draekeun. drakkerkin dosk tho arakken sketherin."" it refers to the green dragons as being weak before mentioning the southern part of thebrimhaven dungeon, which containsmetal dragons. make your way there. be sure to bring the primer, combat gear, and somedragonfireprotection as you will need to kill threeiron dragons. make your way to the southern part ofbrimhaven dungeon. once you enter the room with steel and iron dragons, another instance prompts you. note that if you are mid-combat (being attacked) while entering the room with steel and iron dragons, it may be difficult to respond to the instance prompt in time before it is cancelled due to combat. entering and exiting the mysterious entrance to the west of the dragons will cause the prompt to be displayed again. hannibus will again speak to the dragon, but this time have a difficult time with the ferocity of thesteel dragon.  tell him he can do it, it's the only way he will get home, and other things to boost his confidence. you will need to defend hannibus while he attempts to bond with the dragon by killing three iron dragons, to the rider's reluctance. eventually, the steel dragon will be tamed. hannibus reveals the dragon's thoughts; it had witnessed a tall, pale-skinned creature pouring molten metal into dragon eggs, infusing them with strange sorcery. few survived, but those that did hatched as metal dragons. meanwhile, their tormentor made notes onto a wall ""near a secret dungeon entrance"". find the notes on the wall near the entrance to thebrimhaven dungeon resource dungeonfor the next clue.  the next phrase reads: ""ortha draekeun hok kreath draekeun traken. kreath draekeun traken ortha lith kerapac reageth carratas. drakkergin dosk ven arraken."" it refers to a certain black dragon as the ""first dragon"" and also mentionskerapacand a dungeon. this means you will have to visit thequeen black dragonin her lair beneathrimmington, for she was the first dragon ever created, namely by the dragonkin kerapac. travel to thegrotworm lairand make your way to the lowest floor. choose theinvestigateoption on the portal to the queen, as right-clicking and selecting to pass through it will start a fight as usual. it will once again prompt you to enter the cutscene. continue to appear in her lair along with hannibus, who will speak to her in her sleep, stating that it would be best if she were not to wake up. the queen proceeds to channel through him, thinking the situation to be a good dream where she prevents an ilujanka from dominating her. amused by your, the ""dream-thing's"", response, she will agree to answer any questions. ask her about thedragonkinand she will be infuriated, cursing ""you bring me dreams that i do not wish to dream!"" she remembers the dragonkin taking her white-scaled children for experimentation. she says they were taken to a dungeon ondragontooth island, and given twisted powers that drove them mad. hannibus will exit her dream and the two of you quickly leave before your presence wakes the queen up. you can use adungeoneering capeor wisp colony teleport orhoardstalker ringto teleport directly to thedragontooth island resource dungeon. if you have completedpieces of hate, thebig book o' piracycan be used to teleport to dragontooth island. alternatively, you can travel toport phasmatysby whatever means you wish, and bring anghostspeak amulet(unless you own themorytania legs 3) and dragonfire protection. speak to theghost captainby the small dinghy and travel to dragontooth island, and run to the far side to find a resource dungeon. enter it to find yourself in a large cavern full ofcelestial dragons, and speak to hannibus. he senses their madness and concludes he will need them to focus their rage on a single target so that he may find a way to bypass it. therefore, you need to engage one of the dragons in combat, although you must not kill it, merely distract it. a progress bar will be displayed to indicate his progress, reaching 100% after being in combat for two minutes. the typical way is to attack a dragon once with any weapon (preferably one-handed to wield withanti-dragon shieldvariants) and then cease attack, tanking the damage until hannibus completes the progress. several pieces of decent food andprotect from magicordeflect magicare recommended (deflect magic never kills a celestial dragon alone here). stay out of melee range from the attacking dragon so it will not deal any non-magic damage. turn off auto-retaliate to prevent any accident. beware of their special attack, which traps you in time for a fewgame ticks, leaving you unable to eat and potentially killing you from stacked damage inflicted during this period if you are low on health.anticipationwill not stop the stun from occurring, but you can break free from the stun withfreedom. once the dragon has been fully studied, you will speak with hannibus again. alternatively, you can bring supplies to kill several celestial dragons in order to gain some combat experience, as this also allows quest progress. if you have access tosuper antifirepotions, you can hit the dragon once, unequip your weapon, and you will take no damage as long as you stay out of melee range. simply wait until hannibus is done. the celestial dragon is calmed but is unable to feel time. hannibus sadly concludes that their eggs had been infused with the strangeness of another place,abyssalmagic, twisting them outside of time.[4]however, he senses nothing about travelling between worlds, although he is able to see a glimpse of a ""brilliant white dragon disappearing through holes in the sky."" thiswhite dragonhas hidden under the protection of hannibus' old mount, theking black dragon. therefore, hannibus suggests to go visit him in his lair. if, instead of mentioning theking black dragon, hannibus says that this lead is a dead end, it means that the mysterious statues task has not been fully completed. complete that to get the next clue. leave dragontooth isle and travel to the king black dragon's lair, either by activating the artefact found north of theedgeville monasteryor simply going to thelava maze(which is more dangerous) and choose the option to continue the quest. despite the warning shown at the edgevilleartefact, you do not have to be in the wilderness at any point, as long as you do not die during the fight. you will reunite hannibus and the king black dragon, and the latter will speak. hannibus will introduce you as a friend who is helping him, and asks the king black dragon about a dragon that is able to fly through worlds. he will explain that there is one white dragon remaining, namedtherragorn, and that she is the last of her kind. he will then take the two of you to a set ofruinson the surface. the king explains that she was hunted, and he hid her in a small dungeon created by thedragonkinin the far north-east wilderness to protect her. he will unlock the dungeon and you automatically go inside. the cutscene is instanced and you don't actually appear in the wilderness unless you leave the dungeon - should you do so, you may return there by using the artefact in edgeville as alternative to walking there. once inside, speak to the white dragon,therragorn, who is distrustful of you as a human. however, she becomes more open when you reveal the identity of your partner, as she respects the dragon riders. hannibus requests that she use her abilities to bring him home, and she agrees to listen to his story. she tells how the white dragons were hunted to extinction to make armour from their skin and did not notice their dwindling numbers due to their solitary nature until it was too late. she will also reveal that white dragons were created by a pale-skinneddragonkinwho mixed his blood with the queen's eggs, but were discarded due to a lack of ferocity. ask if she can help hannibus. therragorn says that she does not know the location of his home and might not be able to go there, to which the ilujanka responds that he can confer the location to her by sharing his memories. she asks what his world is like but hannibus replies he doesn't know, although it used to be a peaceful place when he left it. therragorn asks if she would be able to join him, to which hannibus agrees. as therragorn is about to agree, a trio of dragon hunters barge in and try to murder her. hannibus warns their leader that she is the last white dragon remaining, to which he sadistically replies by stating that her skin would be worth even more. you will have to fight the hunters, consisting of amage, anarcher, and awarrior, all over level 90. they use mostabilitiesplayers can use, but are fairly low in power. be aware of theirstuns,thresholds, andultimatesas they can make the fight considerably harder. it may be beneficial to use hybrid armour as you are being attacked by all three combat styles. since the cavern is not a wilderness area, you can leave the fight by the door or teleport out. if you leave or die, you can use the artefact to teleport back to therragorn. alternatively, you can walk to the cave, which is located on a peninsula near the northeast corner of the wilderness. to shorten the walk through the wilderness, theannakarl teleport, daemonheim wilderness entrance or the deserted keep teleport from edgeville or ardougne can be used. finish off the dragon hunters and speak with therragorn again. angry that her location has been exposed and she will not be safe anywhere any more, she will fly you and hannibus away. the two of you mount her and you fly to the south, but are promptly ambushed by a fireball as you fly abovedaemonheim. therragorn is hit head-on and crash-lands. when you awaken, you will find yourself with an injured hannibus inside a dungeon deep beneath daemonheim, with none other thankerapac, pale of scale, before you. he reveals to be your rescuer and states that, unlike the dragonkin you have met previously, will not kill you, needing you. he states that hannibus has suffered injuries that will kill him if he is not helped, and therragorn, whom he deems a failed experiment, has likely died already. he will offer to heal hannibus from his life-threatening wounds, but only on the condition that you help him by using your world guardian powers to try and remove the curse of the dragonkin. look around kerapac's laboratory, which contains various curiosities such as dissectedgrotworms,dragonsand dragon eggs,strykewyrmsand severalancient effigies, as well as dissection slabs and operating tables, preservation containers, and incubators. if you wish, and when you are ready to progress, agree to kerapac's terms. he will lead you to a room with several portals and a cage containingstrisath, who is bursting with fury. after explaining that he wants to attempt to temporarily decrease the effect of the curse on strisath, kerapac will instruct you to capture and channeldragonkin memoriesfromprotoplasmic wisps, congealed remnants of the energy of the stone of jas, in the same manner you do whendivining. then, you must siphon them into strisath so that he may transport you to a magical construct representing the curse. as a world guardian, you have resistance to divine magic, making you the perfect test subject. there, you will have to overcome whatever it is that represents the curse. collect 25 memories and channel them into the cagedstrisath, then speak with kerapac again. if you're not prepared for the following fight, tell him you need time before continuing. should you leave the laboratory, you may return by speaking to kerapac outside his tower on thedaemonheimpeninsula, south ofwiglaf. he tells you you will face a challenge to weaken the bond the curse has between thestone of jasand the dragonkin. this is the final boss fight of the quest. when you accept and embark on this, you enter the construct and appear in a situation where your mind attempts to make sense ofelder godmagic. you find yourself in an image of the shrine for the deadguthix, who is in the background, and confront anecho of jas, who manifests herself as a mage wearing black armour. it will proclaim your destruction and attack. it is level 133, has fairly high life points and no weakness, and uses a powerfulfire spellin conjunction with mostmagicabilities, including thresholds such aswild magicandasphyxiate, and possibly even ultimate abilities likeomnipower. it is highly recommended to use abilities, either manually or throughrevolutionmode, for this fight. despite its strengths, the echo can be dispatched with a simple ranged setup and a good rotation of abilities without too much effort. it uses stuns very frequently and its abilities do not appear to have a cooldown, which is potentially dangerous. it is also an easy fight using necromancy with tier 60 or abovetank armour. regularly throughout the fight,false usersappear around you in the form ofzamorak,saradomin, andlucien. zamorak will cast a bleed-type effect in the form of falling debris over your current area, saradomin will heal the echo, and lucien will fire a red ball of energy at you that will do around 2000 damage. when they spawn, attack them immediately as each has a powerful special attack. they only have 1 life point, meaning as long as they are hit, they are dispatched. continue attacking the echo of jas until it runs out of health, and then talk to it. it says the creators' blessing is weakened, but cannot be undone, after which kerapac will drag you out of strisath's memories. do not leave the area after defeating the echo of jas, or you will have to restart the fight. you return to the laboratory where hannibus has made a miraculous recovery and strisath has left, having temporarily calmed down. kerapac then makes hannibus an offer; if he agrees to submit himself to his research and to being put in stasis, kerapac will attempt to find a cure for the ilujanka's infertility, seeing that it might benefit the dragonkin as well. however, it could take decades or centuries, if a cure exists at all. hannibus needs a moment to think about it and takes you to the surface for some fresh air (provided you have five free inventory spaces). back at daemonheim, therragorn is revealed to have escaped unscathed and used the memory hannibus gave her to travel to his worldiaia, bringing his great (great great...) granddaughter,sharrigan, along with her. sharrigan explains to hannibus that who is left of their race, who have not produced any offspring in decades, have accepted the olun'dai and are ready to move on from their world, erecting a great tree to carve the history and memory of their kind into, before they go, leaving the world to thegurhand any future inhabitants. kerapac will appear, surprised to see therragorn alive, and remind hannibus of his offer. he will discard the olun'dai as superstitious nonsense and urge hannibus to join him. sharrigan, meanwhile, requests that he return to iaia with her and, old and weary as he is after all those years, be with the ilujanka during their final moments. torn, hannibus asks you for advice. you may question kerapac, therragorn, and sharrigan about what to do, with the dragon stating that kerapac cannot be trusted, although the offer is tempting. once you make up your mind, tell hannibus to return to iaia or to stay with kerapac. if you choose to let hannibus return, kerapac will return to his laboratory, while therragorn is invited to spend her final days on iaia as well, to which she gladly agrees. if you choose to let hannibus stay, he will return to the laboratory with kerapac. thus, the group disband. congratulations! quest complete. one of a kind is directly

head over tosenlitenin theuzer mastabaonce again, residing north-east ofnardah. you can use fairy ring codedlqor thedesert amulet 2or higher to get there quickly. alternatively you can also speak with leela at draynor and she will transport you to senliten. when you enter the mastaba, a short cutscene will appear with dialogue betweenambassador jabariand the pharaoh. talk to senliten, and it will be revealed that osman andleelaare her descendants, not only making them royalty, but also making osman the current true heir to the throne of menaphos. osman knows this, and plans to prove it, but senliten and leela explain that he's going about it the wrong way, and suggest that you try and talk him down. head over toal kharidand talk toosman. you will give him the book, and relay what senliten has told you. osman agrees to go see the two again and resolve things, then tells you to report to theemir. talk with the emir (just behind osman), and jabari will burst into the throne room. he argues briefly with osman, revealing to the emir that osman helped themenaphiteskidnap him by giving them his travel logs in exchange for information about his ancestry. osman responds by revealing that he knows jabari killedemir shah. the emir declares that both men are to be arrested, but jabari uses his magic to create clones and hide throughout the city. now you have to hunt him down in al kharid. when he is found, after some conversation he will teleport away again each time and damage you for 10% of your max health. to begin, go todommik's crafting storein the north-eastern part of the city and make your way up the stairs and then the ladder, onto the roof (following the rooftop agility route taken in previous quests). before teleporting for the final time, jabari will tell you to find him at the duel arena (now known ashet's oasis) for a fight. grab your gear and supplies and head over to the bonfire to the west ofhet's oasis, just north of al kharid. speak with jabari and he will challenge you to a ""fair duel with no tricks"". accept, and he will teleport you into an arena, where you're faced with 8 jabari clones. once you find the real jabari, you must defeat him, using whatever combat style you wish. although this is an easy battle, jabari shouldn't be underestimated. this is a game of spot the difference. in the first round the correct jabari is always the one who is not translucent. after that the real one can be found randomly with the following differences: if you are too slow to find the real one, he will attack you and the difference will be randomised again. this deals increasing damage until the fifth time, at which point the duel is lost and the player can restart from the beginning. players can simply click through all the clones until they find the real jabari if the difference is too small to see.saradomin brewsshould be taken for this method, since the clones deal 10% of your maximum health as damage. after jabari is defeated four times, a cutscene starts, andhetappears to tell jabari he has lost. jabari refuses to go honourably and threatens to urgeamascutto retaliate against both you and het. you inform him that the pharaoh will likely want him imprisoned too, as his actions have threatened the trade deal. he responds by teleporting away. you will be returned to het's oasis. talk tohet(who may be standing beneath you) at thehet's oasisentrance. he will inform you that he,crondis, andapmekenplan to search forscabaras, despite his return being the last piece amascut needs for her plan. het asks that you will stand with the pantheon against amascut when the time comes. head back to emir ali, and talk to him. this triggers a cutscene in which osman is declared a traitor, and is exiled from al kharid. osman swears that he will become pharaoh to cement peace between the two cities, regardless of the emir's feelings toward him, and teleports away. another cutscene will begin with the pharaoh calling for jabari, who does not appear. he will then go on about his goals to ascend to godhood. he then continues calling for jabari to no avail. speak to the emir again after both cutscenes to finish the quest. quest complete!

(if it keeps respawning, hop worlds and try again.) if your path to the southern tunnel is blocked by the monoliths, you can use the tunnel to the north as an alternative passage back to the cave. talk to king bolren again, and he will tell you of a lone gnome namedlongramble, who went in search of the lost city,arposandra, where glouphrie resides. however, no one knows his location and onlygianne jnrat the grand tree may be able to help. use thespirit treeto travel to thegrand tree. bank all unnecessary items and stock up on food and armour. climb up to the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]of the grand tree and speak togianne jnrin the north-west corner to learn about longramble the explorer's whereabouts. he tells you that gnomes have been trying to deliver a dish oftangled toads' legsto him at the coordinates 2 degrees 7 minutes south and 3 degrees 7 minutes west but haven't been able to get through. you can bring him the tangled toads legs if you want to, but that is not required to complete the quest. he will give you alongramble location noteto remind you of the co-ordinates of longramble, as well as providing access to your toolbeltedsextantvia a right-click option should you wish to locate longramble yourself. teleport to thecastle warsarena and head south and then west alongside the river. alternatively, you can use thefairy ringcodebkpand head north-west. use the crossbow to grapple the tree near the bridge and cross to the other side where you can reach the coordinates. talk tolongrambleand he will share his findings regarding the sewer, which he believes is proof of gnomish involvement as elves do not pollute their environment. if desired, you can use tangled toad legs on him, and he will reward you with amint cake. note that the mint cake doesnotheal any health but restores your run energy by 100%. start heading north to the sewer entrance. halfway up, you will come across a dyingspirit treeby the name ofincomitatus. incomitatus has lost his connection to theanima mundias his roots have been corrupted by black ichor.hazelmere, sensing your connection to the anima, contacts you and provides a way to heal the sick tree — as elven magic revolves aroundseren, the divine aspect of the anima, you must use an object that will 'chant' the anima back into incomitatus. use the crystal chime on the spirit tree (or select the ""ring"" option on the chime while standing next to the tree) to heal it, allowing you access to the dungeon. if you do not have the crystal chime, you must get it in the storeroom you visited earlier by using the crystal bowl there. walk west into the dungeon entrance to explore. be sure to bring along your crystal chime into the dungeon as you cannot fight the final boss monsters without it! the cutscene at the end of this section contains bright flashing lights. if you are sensitive to light, have seizures, or are otherwise affected by flashing lights, be very cautious in the poison waste dungeon after the terror bird cutscene. after killing the three monsters, peek through the door on the other side and enjoy a long and remarkable cutscene. players see terrorbirdsguard no. 72arguing withguard no. 21until they detect the player and trigger the traps in the battle room. during the cutscene, do nothing. players are trapped in the battle room and are dealt multiple hits which do not do any actual damage. don't try to escape. wait until hazelmere appears to help. note: taking any action during the cutscene makes the player appear outside the battle room. in that case, the battle does not need to be repeated. re-enter the room without trying to escape and wait for hazelmere. at the end of the cutscene, players are teleported to hazelmere's house. talk to him to complete the quest. the player is damaged by the magical spells and gasses. hazelmere comes to the rescue, and shields the player from the gasses. hazelmere makes the choice to save the player. the path of glouphrie is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:  "

be bloodless and she agrees so long as you can get the other city leaders on board with the coup. she comes up with yet another ""only condition"", this one being you bringing thejack of spadesto justice. speak toozanin the lobby of theshifting tombs. you inform him of what is going on and ask if you can take him prisoner. he declines and gives you hiscowland insists you cover it in blood to make it look like he is dead. use ozan's mask with the bucket of blood next to the fish stall in the merchant district to dirty it with blood. giveozan's blood-covered maskto akhomet in imperial district. she is shocked that you killed him, but impressed that you claimed to have buried his body. she gives youimperial signets. give the signets to batal in worker district. he thanks you and promises to pass them out to the most deserving. he gives you anemployment certification, promising to send his best and brightest workers to wadud. give the certificate to wadud in port district. he says that he will ensure the worker strikes are brought to an end, and directs you to ehsan. speak to ehsan back at merchant district who informs you that she has already received word that the strikes have stopped. she gives her full support. read carefully through before you gear up for the ensuing battle. it is recommended to use ranged or magic, and bringsharkor better food, along withprayer potionsand abeast of burdenfamiliar (war tortoiseor better) as some players may unexpectedly take a lot of damage during the fight. speak to hassan to teleport to the throne room. when you arrive, the cities faction leaders will watch you fight from the far corners of the room. the pharaoh will be enraged by the faction leaders attempting to overthrow him and send fourpalace guards. two use magic and the other two use melee; they are incapable of performing abilities. the melee guards have 20,000 health, while the mages have 25,000. once they are dead you will reach a checkpoint, if you're running low on food make sure to quickly teleport out of the throne room to restock before engaging the next battle. you do not need to fight the menaphos palace guards again. thepharaohwill approach you with 150,000 life points. he can be relatively difficult if you're not prepared and will cast powerful magic attacks, which makes protection prayer against magic very helpful during the battle. the pharaoh's battle will apply corruption identical to thesophanem slayer dungeon, so bringfeathers of ma'atto cleanse it and reduce damage taken, and he spreads green fire that can deal 1,000 damage per tick, so make sure to move around a lot. if you die here, it isnota safe death; your gravestone will appear in the imperial district, west of the shifting tombs entrance. he has three different special attacks, which he uses after every 3 auto-attacks. after losing approximately half of his life points, there will be a small cutscene where the pharaoh removes his mask. he will summon fire around him for a short time, making melee difficult, and his magic attacks will now hit harder - protect from magic will help reducing the incoming damage as well as running around during his three rapid magic attacks. alternatively, you may use adeathtouched dartto quickly end the fight. this method does skip the cutscene where the pharaoh removes his mask. when you beat him, the pharaoh tells you that once upon a time, he prayed to the desert gods to help him rule, but the only one to answer his prayers wasamascut, who corrupted him. his corruption by amascut has been lifted, and desires that you pass judgement. he realises that what he did was horrible and begs mercy in atoning for his sins. at this point, you can decide the pharaoh's fate; exile, execute, enslave or imprison him. you ask each of the city leaders for their opinion, ehsan demanding his execution, akhomet supports imprisonment for his crimes, wadud argues for exile and batal demands hard labour. however, regardless of your decision, osman will appear and declare that it is his right to choose. he then kills the pharaoh by stabbing him in the neck with his dagger. a cutscene begins with amascut,jabariand twothrallsat thesoul altar, with thekharid-ibfloating above.tumekenspeaks through the thralls and jabari, telling amascut to forget her anger, and give up on this task, that he is afraid. amascut insists that destruction is necessary, and screams that she is not his daughter. she finally yells ""i am amascut!"" and power shoots out of the kharid-ib into the four people present, and the screen fades to black. make sure to have a free inventory spot, otherwise therelic of tumekencan be retrieved from one of the menaphite royal guards next to the throne. quest complete!

expeditions and sunkendragonkintemples, as well as the defence ofmos le'harmless, where players must eliminate groups of shambling zombies in order to repair barricades and prevent the zombie pirate invasion from spreading, and the final confrontation against rabid jack. one of the rewards from the quest is anupgradeto thelittle book o' piracythat has teleports tomos le'harmless,braindeath,dragontooth island, andharmony islandand is recharged usingbraindeath 'rum'. the quest also gives insights into the lore behind one of the locations visited in the quest. to start the quest, the player must stand outside aplayer-owned house portaland click on it. this will makepostie peteappear and he will give the player aletter from bill teach. the letter asks the player to revisitrock island prisonto help outbill teach. the player must then make their way to thecustoms sergeantfound in a house in south-eastrimmington. players must then get arrested again in order to visit rock island prison again. the player must use the dialogue option specifically designated for pieces of hate. speaking to the officer and being arrested normally will not bring the player to the rock island prison's instance for this quest, instead of bringing them to the overworld version. the officer will not arrest the player unless they have nothing equipped or in the inventory. there is a locker that acts as abank deposit boxin the house. you will arrive in the same jail cell as previous quests, however, this time surrounded by different pirates, includingbill teach,madame shih,two-eyed ericandjimmy the parrot. talk to bill teach by shouting through the bars. he will ask the player to aid in their escape by first picking the lock to the jail cell. however, this can't be done immediately as the guards will stop you. after talking to bill, talk to two-eyed eric and ask if he can help a hand. doing so, the player will receiveeric's hook. use the hook on the bed in your cell to receive thepiece of cloth. using this cloth on the hook will createeric's hook attached to cloth. using your newly created hook, you can go to the east coast of the island and use the hook on the fishing spot in order to receive afish. this will also turn your hook into asharpenedversion of it. after doing this, the screen fades to black and screams can be heard.jennifer bloodspatter,sharktooth emma, andcassie toebeardwill be gone. next, use the fish on the perch rock just northeast of the jail cell. this will attract a seagull namedcount ludwig koppenploppen. after some humorous dialogue, using this fish on the jail door in the jail will make the player throw it at the guard and consequently make ludwig fly after it, scaring away the guards. they will be pushed out of the south entrance of the jail, allowing the player to pick the lock. use the sharpened hook on the cell door to unlock it. make sure to block the door that they left out of using the barrels found next to the door. after leaving the cell, attempting to use the hook on bill's jail cell will result in it being opened, but the hook will then be taken away by a rat. in order to catch the rat, the player must construct abaited trap. players can pick up asmall cratefrom a pile of crates next to bill's cell. they can also pick up awooden spoon, acheese sandwich, and apineapplefrom the desk around the corner. searching the locker next to the desk will also give the player a customs officer's uniform. to create the trap, the spoon has to be used on the crate and then the cheese sandwich on theunbaited box trap. this will create abaited trap. the baited trap must be used on the rat hole found on the wall inside of bill's cell. doing this will catch the rat, whose name iswilson. players must then interrogate wilson in order to get him to give up theguard's keys. the correct chat options to choose are 3, 4, 2, and 4. use these keys on the other jail cells in order to free the rest of the pirates. click the door in the centre, leading to the stairwell. players must then talk to madame shih who will say that the top floor of the prison must be reached. attempting to use the guard's keys on the door leading to the stairs will not work. speak to madame shih once again to reveal that someone has placed a ward on the door. speak to jimmy the parrot and he can repeat what he heard the guards say to remove the ward. click on the door and jimmy will recite the phrase, and the door will be opened. before heading upstairs, make sure to investigate the poster right next to the stairs in order to reveal that thefirst floor keysare hidden underneath one of the beds on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]. going up will reveal acrassian guard; however, it will ignore you as long as you have the customs officer's uniform on. searching the lockers north of the stairs will give the player a bottle of'rum'. using the previously obtained pineapple on the slime found next to the stairs will give the player asticky pineapple. this must then be used on wilson who is still in your inventory to makepineapple wilson. use this on the south-west door to distract the guard. after the guard has been distracted, go into the room and search the north-eastern bed to obtain thefirst floor keys. (if the ""investigate"" option does not appear on the bed, make sure you searched the poster in the previous step.) this will unlock both the doors leading into the room containing the strange eggs. enter the northern door where wilson and the guard have been distracted. using the 'rum' on any of the strange eggs will cause them to set on fire, distracting the crassian guard and will allow access to the2ndfloor[uk]3rdfloor[us]. (if you drink the 'rum' by mistake, you can get another bottle from the locker.) walking up the stairs to the2ndfloor[uk]3rdfloor[us]will start a cutscene involvingmi-gorand amysterious figure. they will have a short talk about their invasion ofmos le'harmlessbefore noticing you. this will force you all the way to theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us]where everyone else will have noticed that they have been noticed and will run towards the north of the prison and east to the docks to dive off the pier. diving off the pier will land the player,bill teach, andmadame shihon the east coast ofkaramja. after landing on the east coast ofkaramja, talk to eitherbill teachormadame shih. talking to them reveals that neithertwo-eyed ericorjimmy the parrotmade it back to the mainland, claiming that a monster of sorts grabbed them. continuing the conversation, they will offer you a teleport back tomos le'harmlesswhere they say that they should meet underneath the bar. accept the offer to teleport. this is a good time to visit the bank on the island to get the two pieces ofleather, agold bar, ablurberry special, adrunk dragon, achocolate saturday, and the optionalvarrock teleportor alternative teleportation items. go to the north-west part of the city and sit on the chair in the north-east corner ofharpoon joe's house of 'rum'. the player will ask the barkeep if they want the ""long drop"". accepting this will push the chair forward and into the hidden base. inside the base, you will find yourself back with bill teach and madame shih, along withcap'n izzy no-beard,brass hand harry, and azombie pirate head. when it comes time to interrogate the head, interrogate him kindly and then say you can come to an agreement. the head will claim to know the location ofrabid jack'sbase of operations, but will not lead you there until you do a few things for him first. he will ask the player to find him a pet to spend their time with and also a spot along the sea in order to see the sunset properly. he will jump into your inventory in order to get these tasks complete. to get the pet, players must visitgertrudeto try and get a kitten. upon visiting her, she says all her kittens have already been rehomed to different adventurers and tries recommending talking to one of her children.kanelandphilopcan be found in the house, whilewiloughandshilopcan be found in varrock centre. talking to either kanel or philop reveals that they have heard potential kittens at the abandoned house north of theapothecaryin south-westvarrock. the easiest way to get to the house is to usehome teleporttovarrock lodestone. once there, enter through the door and once inside, search the jiggling crate (show on map) to find thatwilsonhas made his way mainland. the head will be happy with wilson being his pet, and wilson agrees. he will then ask the player to make a collar so that others cannot claim wilson. this can be made out of two pieces ofleatherand agold bar. in order to see a sunset properly, you will have to bring the head to thekaramjacoast. the exact location is just south-west of the deposit chest located south of thekaramja lodestone. walking close to the spot will prompt dialogue from the head saying that it is the perfect spot. placing him down by the coast, he will realise that something is missing. he will first ask for ablurberry special, but find that it isn't perfect. he will then ask for adrunk dragon, but still not find it to be perfect. he will then ask for achocolate saturday, which he will be satisfied with. premade versions of the drinks do work, you can purchase all three for30each atblurberry's barin thetree gnome stronghold. once he has drunk the drinks and seen the sunset, he will say he is happy and will reveal the location of jack's base of operations, but will not say it until he is back in the secret basement. once back in the basement, the head will reveal the location of jack. once revealed, madame shih will offer that they can leave immediately. prepare for combat before proceeding. head to the southwest part of the island where you will find a rowboat. the rowboat is marked on theminimap. the player and the rest of the crew will arrive at the supposed location of the base of operations. however, upon arrival, there is nothing but ocean. madame shih notices that the ship has been slightly damaged due to some coral reefs, and will ask the player to repair the hull below deck. enter the door found south of everyone to attempt to go below deck. before going below deck, however, rabid jack will appear and taunt the player before abducting madame shih and teleporting away. after this, tentacles will appear around the ship, which have to be attacked and killed. once all four have been killed, a cutscene will start, wherezogothappears. again, like its counterpart, the main body takes up one end of the ship, and it is from that point that melee attacks, and special attacks, will be launched. if standing towards the back half of the ship, zogoth can slam down tentacles onto the player and deal typeless damage. these can be dodged, however, it is tedious to do so; it is therefore suggested to stay in melee range. its attacks include a water jet that knocks players to the back of the boat where the boss fight is situated and a melee attack but will only use it when in range. the water jet sprays a stream of water from one side of the ship to the other.  it will only reach the half of the ship closest to zogoth, so can be easily avoided. at half and quarter health intervals, zogoth will temporarily shield itself from attacks and spray acid from above. the shield blocks direct damage from the player, however area of effect attacks (such asdeath's swiftnessorsunshine) and damage over time effects (such ascombustordismember) may continue to harm him.  the damage from acid sprays can be avoided by running away from shaded spots. zogoth is also able to summon minions in the form ofcrassian warriorsandscouts. the warriors will attempt to attack the player within melee range and will try to move to the player.  if the player is attacking zogoth with ranged or magic attacks, it is possible to kill the summoned crassian warrior before any damage is taken. the scouts, however, will attack the player from the opposite end of the ship to where zogoth is. it is best to ignore this minion if attacking with melee, as entering melee range (includinghalberdrange) can cause a tentacle to appear, which will hit the player for typeless damage until either the player retreats or dies. if the player retreats, the tentacle also retreats. if you die, your gravestone will appear at the edge of the dock on mos le'harmless. after defeating zogoth, you will be brought back tomos le'harmlessto find out that jack has invaded the city with his crew ofbarrelchests,dkss,zombie captains,zombie pirates, and invading boats. there are two waves to deal with, the player is required to clear four areas in the first wave and seven areas in the second. barrelchests and zombie captains must be killed before each objective can be completed. after clearing an area of all zombies and completing the objective, its corresponding section in the interface will disappear. if areas are not cleared quickly enough, the number of skulls in the interface will increase and eventually turn red, indicating that zombies are spreading to other areas. spreading zombies will cause zombies to respawn in areas that may have already been cleared, prolonging the invasion further. if unable to finish second wave, players restart with the first wave. information on each wave is listed below: prioritise the top of the list and save the bottom of list for last. once the attack onmos le'harmlesshas been fended off, the player will realise that the invasion was too easy to fend off and will wonder whether it was just a distraction. at this point, if the player has a familiar summoned, it will need to be dismissed. the player will be asked to go tobraindeath islandto check ifmi-goris there. a teleport to the island will be offered. alternatively, talk topirate petenorth-east ofport phasmatysor use thepirate spell sheet. if you do not get the teleport option, continue the dialogue by using the rowboat at the south west part of mos le'harmless. once at the island, the player can walk south, then west and climb down any of the three wooden stairs. continue to west side of distillery and climb up the wooden stair, continue east (pastdavey), then north and east to the west side of the room to find mi-gor,captain braindeath, andmechanical murphy. listen at window near the sink to overhear some conversation. mi-gor wants the secret ingredient to thebraindeath 'rum'for his plans, however, captain braindeath refuses to give it up. mi-gor orders braindeath'sbrewersthrown into thefever spiderpit unless he reveals the secret. braindeath spots you from the corner of his eye and claims that the secret ingredient iswitchwood. however, murphy sees through his lie and mi-gor has the rest of the workers killed. now talk to davey about witchwood and he will reveal that braindeath was referring to a plan called 'operation witchwood'. he will then give you abarrelchest disguiseto use for infiltrating the plant. head out of the factory again and climb down the wooden stairs into an open space and equip the barrelchest disguise. the player must then talk tocaptain donniesouth of the factory and demand that he fetch some witchwood. donnie will do so by taking50% luke'slegand giving it to you. keep wearing your disguise. return to davey and then attempt to get past the barrelchest at the south entrance of plant, who will ask for a passcode. speak to captain donnie once again and tell him that mi-gor wishes to see him. he will then tell you to go in his place, but quickly decides he wants to do it himself since he has a grudge against him. you will overhear the passphrase, and after the cutscene, donnie is ejected from the brewery for his vulgar language towards mi-gor. use it to enter the brewery, and go up from the south-eastern ladder. head to the north-western corner of the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]and put the leg into the pressure barrel and use the lever next to it to press it down. after forcing the leg down the hopper, the distillery will explode and rum will go over everyone in the distillery. pick up thebarrels of 'rum'on top of a crate in the south or northwestern corners and head back downstairs, walking past the guard to head back outside. at this point, the disguise can be taken off. head back over to50% luke, who is now 66.6...% luke, to go through the gate. you can also choose to have a humorous chat about nicknames with him. head to the top of the hill past the gate and investigate the perch rock near the stagnant water, causingbaron von hattenkrapperto arrive. the player will ask him to bomb the entrance to the dungeon to let some of the crabs escape to disrupt the factory. he will then ask for the barrels of 'rum'. hand them over, and the player will take control of the baron in order to bomb the entrance. after the entrance has been successfully bombed three times, a cutscene will occur where the crabs escape the dungeon. as in prior pirate quests, soothing clips of cute pirate kittens censor the horrifying scene as the crabs lay siege to the brewery, devouring luke, donnie, the barrelchests, and murphy, and reducing mi-gor to a decapitated head. once the cutscene ends, players will find themselves in braindeath's office. speak to mi-gor's head, who unwittingly reveals jack's base of operations. after finding out the location of the base, the player will be given the choice to set sail immediately. before accepting, make sure you have suitable items for a boss fight with you. if you decline the offer, you will have to head back to madame shih's rowboat onmos le'harmlessinstead. after sailing off, a cutscene will occur where the ship will crash and start to set on fire. the player will have to grab a diving suit to the south of ship and then jump ship to the north. this will cause the player to jump to some underwater islands. following the islands along, you will once again encounter thekittenfrom earlier stages of the quest. it will give the player vague unsettling statements, though they are not necessary to continue the quest. following the islands will bring the player toulthven kreathwhererabid jackcan be found. enter thesunken temple, where you will seerabid jackstanding next to a portal where a giantblack handwill appear. he will also havemadame shihhostage just outside the sunken temple. frustrated with the player's constant disruption of his plans, he will battle you. this fight used to disallow summoning familiars, but that is no longer true. it is strongly recommended for all players to bring at least level 80 combat gear, as well as high-healing food, such asrocktailorsailfish, including a one-click teleport, such as theectophial. stat boosting potions oroverloads(if available) may also be necessary for those with stats under level 90. in general, the fight should be rather straightforward for higher level players who are familiar with boss mechanics, such as those found inthe heart. however, even with that knowledge, it is very easy to be stunned and killed. thekittenis found again at the entrance to the sunken temple before the fight (small and not easily noticed).talking to the kitten will give the option to turn off effects in the boss fight that can be hazardous to players with epilepsy or other vision problems.this will simplify the combat mechanics to some degree and result in the fight with rabid jack easier to navigate. if you die or teleport away during the fight, you will have to start it again from the beginning.deathduring this fight is not safe, and your gravestone will appear in one of two places. if you went straight into the fight from the previous quest section, it will appear next to pirate pete on the dock north of port phasmatys. otherwise, it will appear next to the rowboat on mos le'harmless. at the start of the fight, jack has 35,000life points. rabid jack fights only with melee and has a special attack where he will grab the player, stunning them for a prolonged period of time and dealing small but rapid amounts of typeless damage. to counter this, useanticipationbeforehand to block it, orfreedomto clear it. this will stop both the stun and the damage he deals with it. the likelihood of him grabbing you appears to increase if you run away from him; for this reason, melee is recommended over ranged or magic. damage jack as quickly as you can using high damage abilities, watching for the black hand from the portal. it will occasionally smash down on the player's position, dealing with 5,000–10,000 melee damage if you are hit by it. you can avoid the hand by standing at the north, west, south, and east wall or doorway (furthest away from the centre). leave freedom on standby, as the hand's heavy damage can easily get you killed if you are stunned when it slams down on you. there is also an insanity mechanic when battling jack, shown on thebuffs and debuffsbar as a black cat icon. to counter this, drink from the barrels of 'rum' littered around the room. avoid drinking more than five barrels though, or you will take up to 90% of your maximum health as damage due to alcohol poisoning. the higher your stacks become, the camera will rotate wildly and more hallucinations of jack will appear. these hallucinations have 1,000 life points, and can easily be killed with area-of-effect attacks such ascleaveandhurricane. other effects such as npcs and objects may appear randomly but do not affect you in combat. the hallucinations that can appear are the following: rabid jack can also remove your weapons and gear, similarly to thechaos elemental, if you have free inventory spaces. simply re-equip them if this happens. when jack reaches 0 health, he will become unattackable, but he cannot attack you either at this time. loosen one of the four ancient chains, after which jack restores his health. the chains can be found in each corner of the room. after loosening a chain it is advisable to move to another chain location, near a barrel of rum (close to the wall to avoid the black hand), and rabid jack will follow you to this location to continue the fight. loosening a chain resets the number of 'rum' you can drink. an effective strategy for the fight is to begin at a safe area at one of the doorways, near a barrel of 'rum'. eat to full health, then break free of any stuns with freedom. drink a barrel of 'rum'. this will cause the hand to disappear and allow you to temporarily avoid the possibility of heavy damage or death from its attacks. after drinking the 'rum', bring jack to zero life points, and click the chain to loosen it. move to the next chain clockwise, the safe point near to the wall or doorway, out of reach of the hand. repeat this a total of three times. when jack has been reduced to zero life points for the fourth time, a cutscene will trigger which will loosen the final chain and the fight will end. after defeating jack, he'll realise that you've almost sealed the portal. taking no chances, he grabs onto a chain and drops into the portal, which is closed by the boulder that you loosened during the fight. talk to madame shih. you can speak to her about the recent event, but regardless, she'll tell you to meet her back in the basement. head to the basement, where the pirates of mos le'harmless will celebrate jack's apparent demise. madame shih is a bit wary, knowing that they did not

what's going on. travel to the north-western part ofeast ardougneand talk toedmond. he can be found in his garden, just north of theflying horse inn. edmond tells you that his daughter,elena, has gone towest ardougneto investigate aplagueand he is very worried about her. offer to help and he'll tell you to talk to his wife,alrena, about obtaining gear to shield against the plague. alrena, who is inside the house, says that she can make agas maskif you can get her somedwellberries. while you're inside the house, make sure to get apicture of elena, as you'll need it for later. you can pick up some dwellberries inside themcgrubor's woodenclave, by entering through the railings on the northern boundary, but beware of the level 33guard dogswithin. give her the berries, and she'll make you a mask. if you lose the mask, there will be one in the wardrobe. talk to edmond again, and he'll tell you that direct access into west ardougne is not possible, for obvious reasons. he, instead, has a plan to dig under the wall all the way through to theardougne sewers, and then proceed into the city. first, you'll need to soften the ground. one by one, use your buckets of water on the mud patch in his garden to make the soil soft enough to dig into, then pick up thespadein the garden and dig through the soil into the sewers. if you didn't bring water, there is a bucket spawn in the garden, along with a water source inside the house. edmond will follow you inside. walk to the south, and you'll find a pipe blocked by a grill. try to pull off the grill, but you find that you're not strong enough to do it alone. just use a rope on the pipe and talk to edmond to get him to help pull off the grill. edmond tells you to meet up with his friend, jethick, who can help you in finding elena. now that the way has been unblocked, put on your gas mask and climb inside to enter the plague city. once inside west ardougne, talk tojethick, who can be found in the town square. ask him about a girl named elena, showing him herpicture. he'll tell you that elena indeed is in the city, helping people, and is currently at the rehnisons' house. jethick also requests you to give back a book that he borrowed from the family. the house is located north of the town square. try to enter the house and you'll find that it is locked. knock on the door, and mention that you are jethick's friend and are returning a book, and they'll let you in. once inside, talk tomarthaorted rehnison, who tell you that elena used to stay at their house and was planning to leave, but something terrible happened. they tell you to talk to milli, their daughter, who can be found upstairs in her room. when you talk tomilli, she says that she saw elena being kidnapped by some shadowy figures, when she was playing in the south-east corner of the city. elena was shoved in a sack and taken to a boarded up building, marked with a big cross, which had no windows. head back out of the house and south of the town square to find the house that milli told you about. it is behind (south of) a row of crumbling houses, south of the broken-down chapel. try to open the door, but themournerswon't let you in because it's been hit hard by the plague. tell them that you're looking for a kidnapped girl and that you want to check regardless. they'll tell you that you need to apply for clearance from either thehead

urgent, and he'll let you inside to see bravek. he is located upstairs, in the eastern room. he can hardly talk to you, though, as he's badly hung over. he'll give youa scruffy notewith a recipe for a hangover cure that his herbalist,trudimade for him. to make the cure: give the concoction to him. he drinks it, and says that he feels much better now. when you talk to him about the plagued house, he says that mourners usually deal with these issues, but if you say that the mourners won't listen to you, he writes you awarrantthat grants the permission you need to go search for elena. head back to the house and try to enter again. use the warrant on the mourner guarding the east door to show it to him. they will talk amongst each other about the authenticity of the warrant, giving you a chance to sneak inside. search thebarrelon the west side of the staircase to finda small key. then go downstairs to the basement and unlock the cell door to release elena. she tells you that she was about to return to east ardougne with some samples to analyse and find a cure for the plague, when she was kidnapped and kept captive. she thanks you and tells you to talk to her father, who will reward you.

toarianwynin the eastern-most house. he greets you and mentions that the dwarves have managed to clear the rock-slide in thecorridor of light, allowing him to finally sneak intoprifddinasand see whatlord iorwerthis up to. unfortunately, the path is being monitored by the deathguards (mourners), so you'll first need to disguise yourself with a set ofmourner gear. with the camouflage equipped or in your inventory, speak to arianwyn again to teleport to the corridor of light. if you speak to the dwarf in the corridor, he'll talk with you about thereportthat he found on the dead elf underneath the rubble (the one that you discovered at the end ofwithin the light). the note was written by the elven archaeologistiestin edern, who reports that the entire city of prifddinas has been reverted to a crystal and, with thetemple of lightup and running once again, he hopes to see the elven city restored to its former glory. head west across the corridor and enter the door at the end to emerge in a storeroom. continue past another door into the next room, where thedeathguard captainwill demand to know what you were doing in the storeroom - if you answer any questions incorrectly, arianwyn will teleport you both back to the corridor of light. while speaking with her, say that you ""thought you saw a mouse"", that ""it might have gotten into the food stores"", and that you ""didn't tell her because you knew she was busy"". if convinced, she tells you to relieve the guards in the room to the west, who are keeping watch on iestin. simply talk to any one of the guards to relieve them. speak to iestin and he will tell you about his work on lord iorwerth's plan of regrowing prifddinas from its crystal seed, albeit without the need of the remaining seven elven leaders. iorwerth is trying to power up the crystal using a secret source of magical power - iestin mentions hearing something about a 'dark lord' - and wants him to prepare the crystal to receive that power. before getting back to his work, he asks you to bring his report to themayor of prifddinas. arianwyn suggests you take up the task and try to learn more about iorwerth's plan while there.iestin's reporttalks about his progress on regrowing the crystal, but that he would be able to work faster if he knew the overall plan, and particularly what power source iorwerth intends to use. take the stairs to the north to arrive at the surface camp in prifddinas, where you will findstarving elvesand mourners. enter the northern building and speak to the mayor. she proceeds to talk about lord iorwerth's drab writing inhis new master planafter the temple's defences came back on, and how iestin's report should keep her busy while she waits on a shipment of gnomish foods fromarposandra. she asks you to check up on the delivery for her. head south to thegnomecopter, and talk to the mourner standing in front of three starving elves and tell him the mayor wants him to distribute the food amongst everyone. go back to the mayor and tell her the food is being distributed by the guards; she will hastily leave in anger, giving you the opportunity to grab the master plan off her desk. head back to iestin and show him the master plan. after reading through the document, he'll conclude that iorwerth wants to summon thedark lord, which would require a significant amount of death energy, and use its power to regrow prifddinas. since the death altar inside the temple of light is out of reach, he has decided to perform a mass-killing of all humans inwest ardougneand convert the resulting death energy into necromantic power for the summoning ritual. arianwyn will tell you that they might have a chance of overthrowing iorwerth by raising a rebellion against him. to this end, he asks you to get the civilians of ardougne on your side by showing the master plan to bothbravekin hiscivic office of west ardougneinwest ardougne, andcouncillor halgrive, who is just outside theeast ardougnechurch. head to east ardougne and speak to the councillor located south of the chapel, who is shocked by your accusations, but believes you, owing to your reputation. he gives you aproclamationthat offers control over the entire east ardougne army against the mourners, provided you already have the support of west ardougne. next, speak tobravekon the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]in the west ardougne civic office, and he will reveal that he already suspected that the 'plague' was a hoax all along, and it was fairly obvious for someone living inside the city. however, he chose to appear ignorant as he didn't want to 'catch the plague'. while he is unable to help you himself, he gives you alistof people that you can recruit to start an uprising. make sure that you've unequipped your gas mask, and speak to the following people in any order: once everyone is on board with the plan, meet up and speak to any one of them in the west ardougne church to finally start the revolution. head to the mourners' headquarters in the north-eastern corner of the city, kick in the door and kill all of the mourners on the ground floor. continue down through the trapdoor in the north-west corner and kill all the remaining mourners. note: due to a bug, the door may not be there to kick in. lobbying or hopping worlds can help to bring the door back. once you defeat thehead mourner, you can choose to interrogate him about iorwerth's master plan, but you realise that he was simply following orders. you can then choose to kill or spare him; if you choose to spare him, he will reappear in prifddinas after the end of the quest. when all the mourners are defeated, elena will give you a flag to replace with the flag on the roof of the headquarters. head upstairs and plant the new flag, which will causesir hugo, apaladin, andsir edmond, aknight of ardougne, to arrive at the scene and command you to leave the building at once. show them the councillor's proclamation and, after arguing about whether to follow the council's orders or supersede their authority, they will go back to the castle - sir hugo to defend king lathas from a coup, and sir edmond to prepare the knight army for your aid. prepare yourself for combat and talk to sir edmond near the entrance to the east ardougne castle. get up to the king's bedroom and killsir hugo(level 107), who is guardingking lathas. once he's dead, talk to the king and ask him about his motives for partnering with iorwerth. he'll tell you about how his father,king ulthas, decided to split up his kingdom by kicking out thesinclairsfrom thecamelot castleand giving it to anew king from another world. he also shared a piece of the kingdom with lathas' younger brother,tyras. to achieve this, lathas promised to help iorwerth summon the dark lord in exchange for his help in re-occupying camelot and overthrowing tyras. after the dialogue, you can choose to either let him live or die. after the successful campaign, head back to iestin by either using arianwyn's offered teleport or climbing down the hole near the east gate of prifddinas. iestin and arianwyn inform you that even though iorwerth's plan was thwarted, it may only serve to delay the inevitable, and therefore the only way to stop him is to regrow prifddinas before he can. since whoever grows the city ultimately controls it, you must now find and recall the eight elven leaders, whose combined magical abilities can safely form the city and keep it under the collective control of eight clans, instead of one. iestin mentions that he knows enough about the iorwerth clan and their magic, and so he can fill in their clan leader role, and thatarianwynis actuallylord cadarn. arianwyn suggests locating the remaining six elders by talking to the elven scribe,gwir, in lletya and bringing them back to perform the ritual. teleport to lletya by speaking to arianwyn and talk togwir(north of the bank) about the lost elders. she will ask you to retrieve a book from the nearby bookcase and read it to discover clues about the leaders' current whereabouts. read the book and go through all the chat options regarding each of the six elders to be able to progress in the quest and gain further information about them. when asked about lady ithell, gwir reveals that she was the one who built lletya as an image of prifddinas' beauty but without the use of seren's crystals, and that she died shortly after finishing it. head to lletya and locate five symbols carved into the wood around the city. the symbols are small and blue in colour. if you are on low detail, the symbols might become difficult to find; rotating your camera angle may help. the symbols are located in the following locations: after inspecting all the carvings, you will discover that they form a design for a statue in the heart of lletya, built using 10magic logs. head to the centre of lletya and you will find a new construction hotspot for the statue. build theithell statue, andkelynwill ask you to come speak to her in the main balcony upstairs. kelyn explains that she is from the ithell clan, and that upon looking at lady ithell's statue, she has promptly gained some of her knowledge and is now equipped at becoming her successor. tell her that it is time to regrow prifddinas, and she will go to theprifddinas undercity. when you ask gwir about amlodd, she gives you a mysterioussummoning charmthat belonged to him. you must now infuse the charm with summoning energy to create anamlodd pouch. although you can choose any summoning obelisk to do this, it is recommended to visit the one near thewell of voyageas it's on the way to findinglady trahaearn, another elder. if you have afang of mohegan, you can teleport directly to the well of voyage once per day. otherwise, exit lletya from the north-west trees, step over the tripwire and pass the dense growth to the west, jump over the leaves to the north, run to the east and enter the cave entrance. once at the well, use the amlodd charm on the obelisk and it will prompt you to create theamlodd pouch. then use it to summonlord amlodd. he will tell you that he was in thespirit planewith the other spirit creatures. tell him that it is time to regrow prifddinas, and he will go to the prifddinas undercity. gwir mentions that lady trahaern was a master of mining and smithing, and that you'd be required to use these skills to reach her. the reference to the well in the clue is actually thewell of voyage. the well is located in iban's temple, located in the large expansive cavern through the crack in the wall by iban's tomb. after summoning and speaking tolord amlodd, head to the cracked wall located south-west of the well (indicated by a red line on the minimap). mine it, and enter the newly discovered cavern. inside, you will be attacked by threetrahaearn automatons- one each for melee, ranged, and magic styles. although they use combatabilities, they are fairly easy to defeat. after they are vanquished, inspect lady trahaearn on her chair to discover that her exoskeleton is broken, and that it can be repaired using arune bar. once fixed, she will float out of her chair, and thank you for repairing her exoskeleton, which she reveals is necessary to keep her alive in her advanced state of ageing. tell her that it is time to regrow prifddinas, and she will go to the prifddinas undercity. gwir mentions that lord crwys was close to nature, being an expert at farming and woodcutting, and he considered trees to be his brothers. cutting any regular trees in theisafdarforest will cause yellow lights to stream towards the direction of lord crwys, and disappear after a couple of seconds. the lights eventually lead to an area near thetyras camp. taking the first of the following two paths will allow you to pickredandblue isafdar mushroomswhich are used for lady meilyr's task. if you cannot pick the mushrooms, you will need to speak to gwir about lady meilyr. teleport to thetirannwn lodestone(blue mushrooms are here) and head west through the dense forest (red mushrooms), followed by going across the tripwire to the north and past another dense forest. alternatively, travel toport tyrasvia a charter ship, head north from thetyras camp, and then east and south to reach the same patch of dense forest. just before passing through the last tree of the dense forest, chop the closest tree on the right, it will infuse the dead tree on the other side of the dense forest and allow you to inspect it. inspect the nearly-dead tree on the west side and use the plant cure potion or castcure planton it. the tree will transform into lord crwys. crwys will tell you that he turned into a tree to escape iorwerth, and that he was sick due to the corruption of the poison wastes by arposandra, and due to thedark lordgrowing in power. tell him that it is time to regrow prifddinas, and he will go to the prifddinas undercity. gwir reveals that thepoison wastesused to be a lake, and that the riddle likely refers to them. you will need to cross the poison wastes to find her, passing across a small maze of rocks. to gain access to the maze, head west out oflletyathrough the tree gate, then south past the dire wolves and magic trees, and jump onto the rocks. refer to the image on the right for the correct path, and continue to travel over the islands all the way west until you reach a small tent with an elf hermit. although she denies being lady hefin, ask her about the wisdom ofseren. once she's done explaining, she'll ask you some questions about what she just said. answer with the following: she will then reveal that she is, in fact, lady hefin, and is impressed by your willingness to admit not knowing and to learn more about seren and the elf race. tell her that it is time to regrow prifddinas, and she will go to the prifddinas undercity. when asked about lady meilyr, gwir will give you ameilyrpotion recipe. read the recipe and you'll see that to make the potion, you need to add groundredandblue isafdar mushroomsto asuper defence (3). the mushrooms can be found in various places in isafdar, the most accessible being the tirannwn lodestone and the area south-west of lletya, near the magic trees. grind the mushrooms and add them to the potion to make a 3-dosemeilyr potion. head todaemonheim(use your ring of kinship to teleport there quickly), which is the ""dungeon of the kin"" referenced in the clue, and drink the potion in the main hall. a portal will appear (just north of the bank) that will take you to a small room within daemonheim, which houses lady meilyr. she reveals that she and the other elves discovered daemonheim duringking baxtorian's campaign, and that she is there to study its rare herbs while hiding from iorwerth. tell her that it is time to regrow prifddinas, and she will go to the prifddinas undercity. return to lletya and have arianwyn take you back to the prifddinas undercity, where all the elders have already assembled. arianwyn will then tell you go to tyras camp and try and convincegeneral hiningto distract lord iorwerth's army while the elders perform the ritual undisturbed. travel toport tyrasand talk to general hining, who will agree to your plan, feeling ecstatic that the wait will finally be over and he and his men will be able to go home. go back to lletya, prepare yourself with combat gear (fire-based magic is recommended), food, and a quick way to teleport out just in case (ranged gear is recommended to avoid attacks that deal 900 damage to certain areas of the ground over time) and speak with arianwyn to teleport back to the undercity. speak to arianwyn again, he will tell you to enter the library. do so and you'll find yourself facing a light puzzle. your objective here is to activate the central seal of seren by powering it with the eight seals protecting prifddinas. to do this, you must guide the light emanating from the prifddinas seeds to the central seal using mirrors, which means you must complete the light puzzle 8 times, once for each elder crystal. some mirrors are already fixed and cannot be rotated or removed (they have a pink reflective area instead of white). these puzzles can be easily performed if you start at the middle and work your way towards the crystal to be activated. you cannot point the light through full beams. also, each mirror can only be rotated in two directions. the layout of the pillars and raised plinths changes after each puzzle. however, the solution images below all use the initial cadarn layout. warning: there is currently a glitch where if you die during the fight, your grave may appear inside of prifddinas before you have access to it, and will be uninteractable by other players. however, your gravestone should normally appear either in lletya or next to the eastern gates to prifddinas, depending on where you last entered the under-city of prifddinas from. additionally, whilst you can teleport out between rounds, doing so after defeating a round of the dark lord will result in having to repeat that round! start by activating the cadarn seal, which is the southern crystal on the east side and is being controlled by arianwyn. go back to the cadarn seal and power it up. twoshadowswill appear, which iestin theorises to be minions of the dark lord. as they only have 100 life points, they should go down in just one hit, although note that they can deal over 800 life points of damage per attack. once they are defeated, move on to the next seal in a clockwise direction - the second seal, trahaearn, is the eastern crystal on the south side. go back and power up the trahaearn seal, which will cause agreater shadowand three shadows to appear. apart from the lesser shadows, you will now also face a greater one that possesses 9,000 life points and has a max hit of over 900. nevertheless, they should be easy to defeat. move on to the iorwerth seal, which is the western crystal on the southern side of the room. power up the iorwerth seal, and the dark lord itself will appear, along with a greater shadow. the dark lord will introduce itself, and reveal that it is the foil to everything living and is obsessed with death. from this point onwards, you will have to fight the dark lord between each seal activation. the dark lord attacks using magic, and has an area-of-effect attack not unlike the one thatdawnuses, which rapidly harms you for 10% of your maximum life points on every hit. it signals this attack by raising its left arm in the air (similar to the animation when you use thewrackmagic ability), as opposed to pulling both arms towards its right side for its regular attack. the dark lord will start off the battle with its area-of-effect blast, and then start alternating between its two attacks. due to the frequency of the area-of-effect attack, melee isnot recommended- as the dark lord and its minions are weak to fire spells, magic is recommended over ranged. owing to their use of magic,protect from magic/deflect magicis recommended. a simple strategy to defeat the dark lord is to keep moving around the arena, casting spells at short intervals. this also helps you avoid the majority of the area-of-effect attacks, although be careful when clicking around the area as it's easy to accidentally engage one of the shadows and stay in one place long enough to get hit by the area-of-effect attacks. when the dark lord has been defeated during a round, you can kill the shadows one at a time by heading to their respective corner and attacking from there. if you hide behind the crystal seals, you may get the chance (particularly on later waves) to attack the greater shadows while being safe from the dark lord's attacks and build up adrenaline. it is possible to bank between rounds; however, you must leave at thestartof each battle, not after it ends, otherwise you will be forced to redo that fight all over again. logging out will return you to lletya, which can be a good way to preserve teleports. once you have banked, talk to arianwyn to be teleported back to the undercity and enter the library to begin the fight again. once the dark lord and its minions are defeated for the first time, move on to the ithell seal on the south-western side of the library. go back and power up the ithell seal. lord amlodd will inform you that directing the beam of light towards the dark lord has harmed it, which means that by restoring prifddinas, you can defeat it once and for all. the dark lord and two greater shadows will attack you once again. defeat them using the same strategy as before. once defeated, head towards the amlodd seal on the western side of the library, just north of the ithell seal. go back and power up the amlodd seal. lady hefin will reveal that her ancestors sealed the dark lord within thetemple of light, and that it is a darkness thatserenwarned them about when she shattered herself into crystals. within the temple, it was attracted to the power of thedeath altardue to its fascination with death. the dark lord and three greater shadows will attack, using the same mechanics as the previous fights. defeat them once again. after the fight, activate the hefin seal, which is the western crystal at the north side of the library. this time, two mirrors - the ones directly south and south-west of the seal - will already be in place and unmovable. go back and power up the hefin seal. with another strike to its health, the dark lord will summon and killlord iorwerthto obtain more power, relishing his death, and describing the deaths of him and king lathas as delicious. it will also reveal that it was responsible for giving magic to the elves and extend their lifespan, claiming that it is in fact seren. the dark lord and three greater shadows will proceed to attack you once again. once he is defeated, move on to the meilyr seal, the eastern crystal at the north side of the library. there are once again two fixed mirrors in this puzzle - the first is directly south of the seal, and the second is just south of the seal of seren. go back and power up the meilyr seal. the dark lord will reveal that it is an aspect of seren, cast out by the other parts of her when she shattered herself at the end of thegod wars. it also reveals itself to be the source of the voices in theunderground pass, and that the deaths of king lathas and lord iorwerth are what granted it enough power to manifest in the library. the dark lord will attack you for the final time, claiming that the soul of a great hero will be a true delicacy. this time, he has four greater shadows and several lesser shadows alongside him, making the fight slightly more difficult. once the dark lord is defeated, move onto the eighth and final seal, which is the northern crystal in the east side of the library. there are many fixed mirrors in this puzzle - the first is directly west of the crwys seal, with the beam facing north. go back and power up the crwys seal, completing the ritual. with all eight seals restored, the resulting light will destroy the dark lord and the city of prifddinas will start regrowing. arianwyn and the other elders will thank you, and reveal that this time around the city will function differently. learning from their past discretion, all the elven clans have decided to open the gates of the city and allow other races inside. arianwyn will want to give you 15 items; if you don't have enough room in your backpack, he will open a bank deposit screen so that you can make room for these items, after which you can speak to him again to claim your reward. congratulations, quest complete!  after defeating the dark lord, exit the grand library and speak to arianwyn, who will offer to teleport you to the entrance of the city. when you enter prifddinas for the first time after crossing the guards at the entrance, the elven clan leaders will be waiting for you, lining the path to the gates of the city. lord amlodd, lady hefin, lady ithell, and lady trahaearn will stand on one side; lord crwys, iesten edern, and lady meilyr will stand on the other. as you pass them, each will say something kind to you, which could be any of the following: you can optionally talk to any of them directly. lord amlodd, lord crwys, lady hefin, iestin edern, and lady ithell thank you for all that you have done for the elves and sing your praises; lady meilyr invites you to explore prifddinas to your heart's content; and lady trahaearn advises you to ""hurry along"" so that you won't miss the growing of thetower of voices. at the front gates, the last elven clan leader, arianwyn, will be waiting for you. he will greet you warmly as a friend, and tell you that you have come at the right time to watch the fruits of your labour. at that point, a cutscene will unfold, which shows prifddinas growing. the elves who were frozen in time when the city was reverted into a seed form spring to life everywhere around the city. the tower of voices rises, and you grab a peek of different parts of the city. at the end of the cutscene, you may finally walk into the city gates. arianwyn will stand at the gate until you walk inside, and then teleport away to his usual location in the cadarn district of the city. prifddinas music tracks will unlock, and the city is now yours to explore. plague's end is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

(note: if you run into a bug where you can't click the x to close the letter without moving your character, right-click on the x and click ""close"", or use the ""esc"" key) once at the surface, golrie will introduce you to his mother, golrana. he tells her that you were using the letter as a bookmark for a few years before you realised that it was really a letter from bolrie. golrana becomes excited and snatches the letter from golrie to read it for herself. eager for the chance to rescue her father, golrana is resolved to go save him by herself, but after a little bit of prompting, she will allow you to accompany her as her ""questing apprentice"". golrana tells you to meet her north of theobservatoryand south of the lava fields when you're ready. golrana will be waiting for you in a clearing withhill giants, just south-west of the entrance to theourania runecrafting altar(zmi altar). speak to her and tell her that you are ready to continue, and you will appear on the other side of the plants west of where you were previously standing. (if you squeeze-past the plant back east, you may encounter a glitch where golrana appears twice, and you cannot squeeze through again with your cloned ""follower."" if this happens, run away from the clone until she loses sight of you.) should you stray too far from the correct path, golrana will disappear. to fix this, either press the ""call follower"" button, or pass back through the plants to find her standing north of the observatory, where she originally told you to meet her. after passing through the plants, head north-west through the path of dead trees until you come across a large and decayingdead tree. search the tree to reveal the entrance to a cavern. enter through the tree to find yourself in a tunnel. a wide chasm prevents you from continuing forward, and golrana will suggest that you look around to find a way to cross it. investigate the southern wall to reveal a crossable ledge. golrana quickly dismisses the idea of you crossing the ledge, maintaining that your legs are too ""freakishly long"". golrana will cross the ledge herself and throw a rope across the rift for you to traverse. after crossing the rope, head further south (follow the south-easternmost route) until you come to three separated plateaus, each accessible by jumping from the previous plateau. each jump will have a shortcut icon denoting it on the minimap (). to jump over, click on the gap itself, not the ledge. continue along the path until you reach a small stream with stepping stones blocking the way (follow the north-westernmost route). there won't be enough stepping stones for you to navigate it successfully, so golrana will need to reach the other side and push an extra stone into the stream for you to cross. investigate a crevice on the south wall, and golrana will squeeze through, telling you to stay put and wait for her to get back. she will appear on the other side and move the extra stepping stone into the brook, allowing you to cross. cross the stream by jumping from one stepping stone to the other; it is only possible to jump to a block that is no more than 2 spaces away from your current location. upon successfully crossing, travel north and around to the south-west corner through the tunnel until you reach an opening leading out of the cave. note: when you reach the exit crevice, you should wait for golrana to catch up, or else you may lose her when you go through. even if she is beside you, if she doesn't have direct access to the exit, she will vanish when appearing on the other side. if she does disappear, continue towards the sturdy tree and use the rope as listed on the recommended items on it. golrana will reappear and the quest will continue. the exit leads into thegalarpos mountainseast oflletya. head as far west and south as you can and investigate the ""sturdy tree"". golrana will express doubt whether the tree will be able to hold your weight. nevertheless, you attach a rope and climb down and arrive in the lletya bank.ilfeenwill be waiting for you at the bank, stating that this is only the second time a gnome has come into lletya. if you have not yet begunmourning's end part i, be careful who you speak to in the village. it is safe to use the bank and shops, and to speak to most of the elves, but if you speak toarianwyn(and possibly some others) you will be teleported out of the village because you don't belong there. if you already had access to lletya from the mourning's end part i quest, that will not be a problem. ilfeen escorts you through the sheep field and through the trapdoor to bolrie's lab, where you finda handwritten bookon a crate next to the ladder. you will need to pick up and read the book in order to access the materials available in the room. the book will contain information as to which materials are required to build the anti-illusion device. in total, you will need: the planks, the long crystal and the short crystal may be found inside various crates throughout the room. the strips of fabric may be found in a crate against the wall directly south of the hammock. the rune glue can be found by searching the picture in the north-west corner beside the hammock. the medium crystal is found on the shelf beside that painting- on the west wall. finally, the light crystal may be found by searching the elven lamp immediately west of the ladder leading into the lab (there are two lamps, search the more northern one). once you have found all of the necessary items to build the device, your character will say that they've found everything. 
head to the table in the east side of the room and click on it to build the anti-illusion device. once the device has been built, you will need to calibrate it to make it fully functional. to successfully calibrate the device, various coins of different shapes and colours must be placed in the 6 slots of the machine. coins may be made by shapingminute crystal seedsusing the singing bowl. additional minute crystal seeds can be found in the northern crate to the east of the singing bowl. the colour of the coin is defined by the current colour of the singing bowl. the colour of the singing bowl can be changed by rotating the crystal through which the light is beamed. each rotation of the crystal will cause the colour of the bowl to cycle through each of the seven colours of the rainbow. different shapes of the coins are formed based on the fill-level of the bowl. an empty bowl will form a circle, a slightly more filled bowl will form an almond (20% full), then a triangle (40% full), square (60% full), pentagon (80% full), and a completely full bowl will form a hexagon. the device will be divided into three sections, each of which has a colour and a number associated with it and 2 slots for coins. the average of the colours of the two coins inserted into the slots and the sum of their values must match with the colour and number provided in the partition. below is a list of coin values based on the colour and shape. the three colours that must be made in order to calibrate the device are cyan, magenta, and yellow, or the threeprimary pigments. only one of the methods have to be chosen. cyancan be made only by combining a blue crystal and a green crystal which both have the same shape. magentacan be made by combining: yellowcan be made by combining: circle crystals are considered to have 1 side. additionally, the numbers corresponding to each of the crystal pieces inserted into the two slots must add up to the specified number. the simplest way to approach the puzzle is to pick one option from above that will combine to find the right colour and determine whether or not different shapes may be selected to also sum up to the specified number. if it is not possible with the colours that you selected, pick a different option from above and repeat. note that there may be multiple solutions in some circumstances. for example, yellow at intensity 15 can be a yellow circle and a yellow square, a yellow almond and a yellow triangle, or a red triangle and a green triangle. if you wish to work out the solution yourself, do not unhide the following section. the following algorithm is what is used by the above calculator. divide the target intensity by 9. this is the number of sides the blue and green crystal must have. if the target intensity is 27, then the solution is a red triangle and an indigo square. else, divide the target intensity by 15. if this number is whole (i.e. it has no decimal/fractional part), then you need a red crystal with that many sides, and a violet crystal with twice that many sides. else, divide the target intensity by 6. this is the number of sides the red and blue crystals must have. divide the target intensity by 5. if this number is whole (i.e. it has no decimal/fractional part), then you need a red crystal and a green crystal with that many sides. else, divide the target intensity by 8. if this number is whole (i.e. it has no decimal/fractional part), then you need a green crystal with that many sides and an orange crystal with twice that many sides. else, you need two yellow crystals. there is no relation between the number of sides. first, divide the target by 3. you then need two numbers which add up to that number, both of which must be less than or equal to 6. those two numbers will represent the number of sides each yellow crystal requires. note that it is likely that there will be multiple solutions, any of which will work. after successfully calibrating the anti-illusion device, speak to golrana and she will offer to take the crystal pieces off your hands and instruct you to meet her back at the lletya bank. exit the cave through the ladder and meet her where you originally met with ilfeen.you must leave the cave using the ladder; if you teleport out, golrana will not be outside the bank. if you teleport out of the cave, you must re-enter the cave west of the general store and exit via the ladder. speak to golrana outside the bank and tell her that you're ready to go on; you will appear next to the sturdy tree east of lletya. start heading eastwards through the forest until golrana stops you and points your attention to an air vent that the anti-illusion device revealed. open the vent, and golrana will hand you a rope to attach to it, allowing you to climb down. head down the vent. after heading down the vent, you will see a cutscene with a gnome that appears to beglouphrietraining a handful of gnomes who have the ability to create an illusion to conceal themselves. after the cutscene, you will fall through the vent and arrive in a room with a few mining tortoises. if you are logged out while you are in arposandra, you may return by climbing the rope in lletya into the forest and heading back through the vent. to get to the rope squeeze through the fence right next to the entrance to the bank. you can also go to the building immediately north of the bank and go through the north door and then squeeze through the fence as soon as you exit. after a short chat with golrana, head up the stairs on the west side of the room to a level with several watchers dispersed throughout the floor. make sure you do not walk in front of a watcher as you will be caught. go east down the pathway until you reach the entrance to a prison with a watcher guarding the entrance. walk behind the watcher and rotate it so that it is facing the wall. enter the jail and you will be confronted byguard no. 103. no matter what option you choose, the guard will become convinced and leave you alone with the prisoner.( update : if you want the guard to leave you alone, say ""my name is *insert your username here*.  followed by ""i am a human ,fear me!"" the terrorbird will then panic and try to press the red button, your character should automatically trick them into saying they passed a test and that they deserve a break, the guard should then leave.) pick-lock the prison door to find bolrie slouched against the wall in the far side of the cell. when you first speak to bolrie, he will suspect that you areglouckdisguised as a human. when you mention glouphrie, he will decide to humour your story and quiz you to determine whether you truly are whom you claim to be. quiz answers: you may also choose ""i don't remember"" to all of the questions and you will convince him by doing the dance emote instead, on the logic that glouck would never do that (or anyone, for that matter.) once you have gained bolrie's trust, exit the prison and head west, past where you originally emerged from the stairs. about halfway through cave, you will stop and instruct bolrie to hide in a small alcove in the passageway. head forward through the tunnel and open the locked door and you will run into golrana. you witness two terrorbird breeders attempt to transform captured terrorbirds by forcing them through a machine. the first one succeeds and turns intono. 202, however the second one, of whichoperator no. 126thought that she was good (""lovely plumage""), transforms into awarped terrorbirdand is dumped in to thesewers. a short while after the process has begun, an alarm will sound, signaling that bolrie's escape has been discovered. heading out of the room, you run into bolrie, and all three of you will head up back to the galarpos mountains. glouck's minions will be in hot pursuit, so you are forced to push a boulder into the vent to prevent them from catching you. now that you are safe from being caught, bolrie and golrana will begin to catch up on the events that have transpired since bolrie's disappearance centuries ago. bolrie inquires about his wife,gena, and golrana woefully informs him about her passing. however, she tells him that she is now married tocaptain belmondoand has a son. golrana will signal for gnome gliders, and captain belmondo arrives to take them back to thetree gnome village. once back at the tree gnome village, bolrie and his brother, king bolren, are reunited, and golrie is finally able to meet his grandfather for the first time. congratulations, quest complete! the prisoner of glouphrie is not currently required for any quests or miniquests. you and golrana traversing the galarpos dungeon. glouckis seen training gnomes in the training room upstairs. the first glimpse of arposandra a mining tortoise as seen in the first room after entering arposandra the machine that was used to createno. 202 an unsuccessful transformation the warped terrorbird is dropped into the sewers. the alarm has been activated!! bolrieandbelmondomeet."

(opening the door just takes you back to falador park) ask korasi about what happened, but she won't remember anything useful. however, she still has some of the potion which you drank earlier to enter jessika's mind. you tell her and sir tiffy you will use the potion to enter korasi's mind to unlock her memories. after drinking the potion, you will find yourself inside a blue plane where you will need to complete a puzzle to advance. talk to the toll booth, and you will be told the objective of the puzzle is to get all three knights as well as yourself across the bridge. however, there are a few limitations you must follow. the first requirement is that no more than two people can go across at a time. the second requirement is that when crossing, someone must be holding the sword. the third requirement is to make the crossing without collapsing the bridge. each person weighs a different amount depending on how much korasi remembers them. the bridge can only handle a total weight of 15. the player weighs 1, bernard weighs 2, ami weighs 5, and diana weighs 8. if two characters cross, only the heaviest weight is counted. so if ami went with diana, the total weight would only be 8. here is the solution: doing it this way makes the equation for weight 2+1+8+2+2=15. after completing the bridge puzzle, you will find yourself next to a toll booth and with the five knights who were on the ship:commodore matthias,korasi,diana,bernardandami. each of them holds a hint as to where the other knights were, what they were thinking about, and what they saw at the time of the incident on the ship. to complete this puzzle, you must correctly assign each person his position, thoughts, and what he saw using the hints given by the other knights. you will know when you have completed the task correctly when after assigning the last npc, the task will end. the hints given are as follows: ami: ""the commodore was thinking about jessika. he didn't see the shark or the seagull and he wasn't in the hold."" bernard: ""ami was thinking about her sister while she was working in the rigging. her sister, diana, wasn't in the hold or at the helm."" diana: ""the person thinking about lunch wasn't in the hold. the person in the hold saw the pest."" korasi: ""bernard saw the seaweed while he was on watch in the crow's nest. he wasn't thinking about a promotion or his sister."" commodore: ""the person on deck was thinking about fighting and she saw a seagull fly by. the person who saw clouds was at the helm."" the best way to solve such a riddle is to make a table, although the solution is provided below. after finishing the second puzzle, there is a cut-scene. you are korasi, in the hold of the ship. (if you teleport or logout during the time on the ship, you will have to talk to sir tiffy again to get back to the temple knights hq. talk to korasi and you will start from the beginning of the ship.) upon seeing a torcher, attack and kill it. after you finish killing it, proceed up the ladder onto the main deck. there, you see the other three knights and a squire fighting pests. a shifter stops you in your path, forcing you to kill it in order to continue. while killing it, the other knights die around you. after killing the shifter, your character automatically heads up the ladder to the helm and finds commodore matthias fighting amysterious figure. (note: there is currently a bug that may cause korasi to not automatically climb the ladder to the helm, leaving the game stuck until you reload the page. this can be fixed by turning your attack mode to auto-retaliate, have momentum and run off before drinking the mind potion that korasi gives you. also, standing near the bow of the ship or activating legacy mode before killing the shifter seem to help.) using the last of his energy before he dies, he teleports korasi toport sarim, ending the cut-scene. once the cut-scene is over, talk to korasi or sir tiffy cashien, without a pet following you. sir tiffy will tell korasi to report back to captain tyr at the void outpost. korasi will ask you to do it for her and you accept. travel back to the void outpost and speak to him. congratulations! quest complete! quiet before the swarm is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

talk tosir amik varzeto start the quest. find him in falador white knights' castle in the western tower on the2ndfloor[uk]3rdfloor[us]. he asks you to join their secret organisation, thetemple knights. if you accept, he directs you to a certainsir tiffy cashiento begin your training immediately. bank all of your items and equipment and talk to sir tiffy cashien infalador parkto take the mental test. sir tiffy won't let you start the test if you have anything in your inventory or equipped. sir cashien will take you to the testing rooms. there are seven different testing rooms. in each room, there is a yellow portal at the beginning of the room which returns you tofalador, and a yellow portal at the end of the room which you may use to travel to the next room after you pass the test. you need to complete five in a row. the first test is always either sir ren itchwood, ms. hynn terprett, or sir tinley. certain other tests, such as sir kuam ferentse arealwaysincluded in the rotation. the remaining tests will be a random selection. if you fail a test, you will be returned to falador and will have to speak with sir cashien again to start over from the beginning. lady tablewill test your memory. she will have 11 statues of a knight in front of her. there are supposed to be 12, but one has been taken away. you will have a few seconds to look at the statues, then the missing one will be returned. you must then touch the one that was missing. the trick to passing this one is to analyse the types of statues. there are 4 statues for each of the 3 metal types: bronze, silver, and gold. first see which type has only 3 statues shown. after you figure out the type, figure out the weapon. there are 4 weapons:sword,halberd,greataxe, andmace. figure out which weapon is missing. after you have figured it out, touch the statue. a good strategy is to take a screenshot of the statues, and use it to find the missing statue. do not talk to her during the ten seconds you have to locate the missing statue, as the order will be reset; however, your ten seconds will not, thus giving you less time to find it again. sir kuam ferentsetells you that you must defeatsir leye, who is level 7. sir leye has been blessed by saradomin so that no man may defeat him. so unless you have a female character, you will not be able to hit the final blow on him. defeat him to pass the test. with low combat abilities it may be hard to hit sir leye without weapons, but the use oflegacy modehelps. you can visit themakeover mageto change your character's gender to female, if it isn't already. if you are a male character, exit through the portal and change your character's gender to female. low-level players may die to sir leye while being any gender, as dying wont reset your quest progress. enter the testing rooms again through sir tiffy cashien and continue testing. complete 5 tests in a row to complete the quest. right next tosir spishyusyou'll see a 5 kgchicken, a 5 kgbag of grain, and a 5 kgfox. you must get all 3 of them across a bridge that only supports 5 kg in one go. the tricky part is that if you leave the fox and chicken alone, the fox will eat the chicken. the chicken will also eat the bag of grain if the two of them are left alone. be sure you wield (take) the item/animal before dropping another. once you complete the puzzle, the door now unlocks and you can proceed to the next puzzle via the portal. speaking tomiss cheevers, you see that to pass this room, you need to make a duplicate key to unlock the final door. she reminds you that there are limited resources, and that if you mess up, you need to leave the room and start all over again. there are two doors that you must get through. the first door is missing a handle, while the second one is locked. firstly, search all of the bookcases and crates in the room to find the following items: you may also findnitrous oxide,sodium chloride,acetic acid,shears, and amagnet, but these serve no purpose. if a player mixes two wrong substances, it creates a useless mixture (??? mixture). you can't get some of the substances back if you mess up so make it count and pay attention to details. when you talk tosir ren itchood, he will speak in riddles, the answer to which is a four letter word, made up of the first letter of each line of his riddle. use the answer to unlock the combination lock on the next door. the possible solutions are:bite,fish,last,meat,rainortime. ms. hynn terprettwill give you a multiple choice riddle. there are many to choose from - here are all the riddles and answers: after enteringsir tinley's room, talk to him and then simply stand still until he speaks to you; it may take a while before he does finally talk to you. if you move, or do anything while you're waiting, you will fail the task. patience is the key to success. congratulations, quest complete! recruitment drive is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

you simply fall right into/over them and take damage. you will need to use the balance log shortcut the first few times you enter the camp. the tirannwn lodestone is not far from your current location, hence it is recommended to activate it now for easier travel. also, if you run out of food, you can kill the rabbits around isafdar and cook them on one of the fire pits in the elf camp. while moving around, you may encounter four different obstacles: if you do accidentally click on the farther side of the trap, it will result in you walking into the trap and falling into a pit of spikes. this will cause you to lose 361life pointsand the only way to escape is by climbing up the wall protrusions. make sure run mode is turned off and then click on the tripwire to step over it. if you trigger the trap while doing so, you'll be damaged and poisoned. upon reaching the elf camp, talk tolord iorwerthand tell him that king lathas sent you. he directs you to meet up with histracker, who can guide you to thetyras camp. teleport to the tirannwn lodestone if activated or head south-east of the camp until you reach it. there will be anelf trackernearby. talk with him and he will refuse to help unless you can prove you were sent by lord iorwerth. return to the elf camp and report to lord iorwerth, who will give you acrystal pendant. return to the elf tracker, who will accept the pendant as proof. he will tell you your current location is the site of tyras's old camp but that the king and his troops have since moved on. he tells you to check the western side of the site. head west a bit and locate the footprints heading into the forest;

former apprentice ofrasial—lord yudura, a necrolord of considerable stature. this necromancer once held dominion overdaemonheimand led a cadre of potent necromancers, ultimately meeting his end, though not by rasial's hand. death tasks you with investigating this matter by seeking out wandering spirits within daemonheim. travel to daemonheim, where your objective is to locate three specificlistless deadwith a ""talk to"" option. these apparitions are not marked a yellow dot on the mini-map, necessitating a more attentive search. the first ghost can be found near the southern fountain, just south of the teleportation point of thering of kinship. the second lingers near the entrance to thekal'gerion resource dungeonto the west, while the third roams along the northern eastern coastline, north of thefremennik ship (shadow reef). despite their restlessness, these ghosts have not encounteredyuduraand express a desire for release into the underworld which the player grants them. after having freed the listless dead, lord yudura contacts you, prompting you to return to the entrance of the castle abovedaemonheim. he awaits your arrival there. consumed by annoyance, yudura discloses his strained relationship withrasial. in exchange for retrieving his corpse, he offers to impart a valuable lesson. this venture takes you through the halls of daemonheim in search of yudura's remains. in the frozen floor you come across the remains ofcaptain toma. denyinglord yudura'sinitial method of reanimation, you explore an alternative approach, leading to revelations about yudura's assassination by the treacherousmoia, who also assassinated toma while disguised as yudura. venturing further onto the subsequent abandoned floor, you searchandelus' corpse, but learn no new insights. continuing your exploration, you approach the remains oftaevas. much like before, this encounter bears no revelations. however, when you searchvengeance's corpse, some information is gained. having absorbedskaldrun's narratives, vengeance imparts a critical revelation—a haunting echo of yudura's demise. within the adorned chambers of a temporary corpse storage room, yudura met his untimely end from moia. upon locatinglord yudura's corpseon the furnished floor, he imparts his lesson—bestowing knowledge about granting life beyond death, a means of exacting vengeance

ritual candle on each of thelight source spots, and draw a glyph on each of theglyph spots(the correct glyph is selected automatically). return to lord yudura in the room to the west. the ritual is initiated and as a result,lord yudurais reborn as anedimmu, a fusion of spectral and corporeal traits, intended to bolster his capabilities. guiding you to the next room, yudura teaches you the lesson you're owed—an understanding that your mortal body is inadequate for confronting rasial. creating a new form, as yudura has just done, is the solution. however, yudura then betrays you: he believes he should be rasial's pupil and needs to replace you. yudura conjures askeletal archer, askeletal sorcerer, and askeletal warrior, which you must fight. the trio alternates protection prayers, much like theskeletal trioencounter indungeoneering, making multiple combat methods helpful. alternatively, as they cannot pray againstnecromancy, you can use adeath guardand askull lanternto kill them. after the trio is defeated, lord yudura is surprised by the player's power, and prepares for a fight. unexpectedly, rasial teleports in. yudura pleads to be accepted back in his new, more powerful form, and surprisingly, rasial seems to agree. however, rasial's response takes a dark turn—instead of granting yudura a second chance as his pupil, rasial kills him in one blow. return todeathin thecity of

some of the people ofgielinorunsettled, and that until he is destroyed, he will remain a threat. reports indicate that vorkath was last seen fleeing toungael. aster requests that you head there to investigate, and advises you to come equipped witharmourandweapons. they direct you to therowboatnear thegrove. upon your arrival onungael, you will be met by a troop of eightzamorakian scouts. a group of the scouts can be heard discussing their mission amongst themselves, which seems to involve waiting for more reinforcements before dealing with the ""dragon"". they also mention their discomfort with their mysterious boss. if you die during the fight with the scouts, you will be respawned by therowboatnear thegroveinstead ofdeath's office. you may either defeat the scouts or enter thecolossal caveto the north-west without defeating them first. the path beyond the cave will lead you through some ruins to a cliff that resembles a necromancyritualsite.vorkathwill be at the edge of the cliff; approach him. vorkath is wounded, but does not show the same hostility he did while underzemouregal's control. upon approaching vorkath, you will be given multiple options. if you choose to study the creature, you will wonder to yourself why he isn't attacking you. you may choose to either end the encounter peacefully or attempt to slay vorkath throughcombat. if you choose the friendly path, reach out your hand and vorkath will flinch. keep your hand extended, and vorkath will respond by unleashing a wave of cold. encourage vorkath, and the frost will intensify. try not the shiver, and vorkath will finally relax enough for the frost to recede. once vorkath has calmed down, you can study him closer. you can tell that he is suffering. at this point a new option will appear for you to use necromancy to lay the dragon's soul to rest. if you choose the aggressive path, secondary prompt will come up asking if you'd like to engage combat. accept this, and you try to damage vorkath in combat. he won't retaliate. deplete all of hislife pointsto continue. regardless of the path you chose, the dragon's soul will be unable to pass on, appearing to be cursed. when you ask vorkath what the matter is, he will produce acrystal shard. inspect the crystal shard. it gives off an unnatural feeling. you recall thearchivisthaving made notes of what happened during vorkath's creation, you decide to head to the library to speak with its projection to learn more. climb back down thestairsthe way you came in, and head up to the fortress through the eastern slope. enter theruins entranceat the top and continue through until you reach theimposing statue. from here, interact with thedoorway (ungael)in the south wall and head towards the library to the south-west. inside, you will find a zamorakiantranslator, who will attack you. when he is defeated, he will drop hiszamorakian translator's notes. reading the notes shows that the zamorakian translator was not bad at translating the archivist's words. search thebookcaseon the north wall near where you entered the library, and you will locatezorgoth's journal. the notes indicate a strong distaste for humans, and bewilderment at the fact thatjashas allowed the humans to live for so long, yet thedragonkinremain cursed.zorgothdedicates himself to punishing the humans in her stead. he bemoans the incompetence of his assistants following the departure oflacrussa, and complains about vorkath's affection for humans instead of his wrath. zorgoth decides that vorkath would be more useful dead than alive, and notes thatkerapachad been studying ablack stonethat can be used to reanimate corpses into violent beasts. zorgoth goes on to detail his replacement of vorkath's heart with one made of the black stone. he mentionskranon'swild experiments with the same black stone. zorgoth takes a more surgical approach, intending to direct vorkath's urges into a pure hatred for humanity. vorkath's response to this treatment was not as zorgoth had intended. vorkath was hateful yes, but also melancholic and wallowing. he no longer displayed affection to humans, but still refused to destroy them. zorgoth declares the entire vorkath experiment a failure, but plans to find other uses for the black stone. you may also search the bookcase again forthe shadow realm. next, inspect thedragonkin muralon the western wall of the library. the mural depicts a huge dragon spewing flames in a far more aggressive manner than vorkath ever did. next, pick up and inspect thecongealed potionon the floor to the south. despite the freezing temperatures, the thick liquid inside is not frozen. finally, search theshelvesnext to the archivist to retrieve abroken focus. inspecting it gives off an unnatural cold feeling. with all of the tasks above completed, you can listen to the archivist about some of them. regarding the mural, the archivist explains that it depicts vorkath as the weapon zorgoth dreamt him to be. regarding the potion, it appears to be a poison that was brewed by zorgoth's alchemists as punishments to coerce vorkath into cooperating. regarding the focus, the archivist states he was keeping tabs on the other dragonkin to see if there were any other breakthroughs in breaking their curse, but only found weakness and distrust among his kin. regarding the crystal, the archivist mentions kranon's failure and descent into madness from his use of the black stone. some of the black stone washed up on the shores of ungael, and the archivist planned to use it to bend vorkath to his will. at the end of the conversation, the archivist will mention that the assistants in the laboratory started to complain of imaginary songs, indicating the black stone's corruption starting to seep into ungael. not finding the answers tovorkath's inability to pass on to the next world, you decide to return tofort forinthryto confrontzemouregal. return to the fort, enter thefloor hatcheast of thecommand centre, and talk to him. you can approach zemouregal in multiple ways to get him to talk about vorkath, with the options to progress through the dialogue having varying effectiveness depending on your skill, quest, and boss progress. selecting unsuccessful options ends the dialogue, requiring you to try again from the beginning. the first selection has 2 or 3 options, depending on yournecromancylevel. the first option, ""show off your mastery of necromancy"", only appears if you have at least level 99 and has 50% chance of succeeding without having reached 120 necromancy. if you have 120 necromancy, it always succeeds and also proceeds directly to the fourth and final selection. the option ""gloat about defeating him in combat"" will only succeed if you have at least 10 kills in thezemouregal & vorkathencounter. the last option, ""mock his skeletal form"", will always succeed. the second selection has two options. ""remind him of the other times you've defeated him"" always succeeds. the success of ""remind him of when you've worked together"" depends on completion ofdishonour among thieves,eye of het ii, andaftermathquests, and requires at least one normal mode kill in thezamorak, lord of chaosboss fight. the third selection also has two options, and both will always succeed. in the fourth selection you initially have three options. you can ask aboutmoia, who zemouregal states has killedbilrachand is attempting to consolidate the power of the remaining forces ofzamorak. asking about the scouts onungaelcauses zemouregal to respond that moia has held an interest in ungael for some time, searching for some very old power that's buried there. naturally, this prompted zemouregal to rush there and claim vorkath for himself. but if moia is still investigating ungael, it indicates there might be more secrets to find there. when you ask about vorkath, zemouregal will confirm that vorkath's soul has been corrupted, and he blames that corruption for his failure to win thebattle of forinthry. you theorise that if the corruption was cleansed, vorkath's soul could pass over. this also causes the final option to appear, and selecting it causes you to decide to speak withdeathin thecity of umto see if he knows how to do this cleansing. deathcan be found in the middle of thecity of um. you describevorkath's situation. death states that what you are aiming to do directly contradicts the typical work of necromancers, but he does believe it could be possible. he states thatrasialalso researched methods of purifying corrupted souls when he was alive as a humanguthixiandruid namedmisalionar. misalionar was one of the most powerful wizards of the time, and was responsible for spreading the knowledge ofrunesto the early settlers ofgielinor. he and death both shared a connection with guthix and became well-acquainted. misalionar became increasingly fascinated and paranoid about death, and confided that he had been haunted by nightmares of smothering black stone hands. these nightmares convinced misalionar that sinister forces were at play, and he dedicated himself to finding ways to counteract them, even if it meant turning against guthix. the last time death had spoken to misalionar, he mentioned a new kind of focus which could be used to push back shadow and light the path for wayward souls. when you ask about the focus, death directs you to thetree of balancejust south of thearchaeology guild, who was planted in the centre of a sacred site that was once used to hold relics like the focus. talk to thetree of balancesouth of thearchaeology guild, who will confirm that it was planted atop such a site. the tree will state that it had lied dormant for centuries prior to its planting, and that it can sense ancient magic through its roots across the land. when asked if the druids knew that the site they planted the tree on was sacred, the tree will state that this is not the first time this exact spot had been used as a sacred grove, but that the druids did not know the significance of this location when they chose it. the tree of balance will state that the focus was torn apart out of fear. its pieces lie far to the west, at thememorial to guthix. the tree states that if you can bring it the pieces, it can repair the focus. head tomemorial to guthixsouth-west ofpiscatoris fishing colony(memory strandsin yourcurrency pouchcan be used to teleport you directly there). just outside the memorial, you can find two patches ofearthen claywhich require 86archaeologyto uncover. thestanding stone debrisin the west  can be excavated to retrieve thedamaged soul beacon (base)and therunic debrisin the east for thedamaged soul beacon (core). the two artefacts do not take long to excavate, but the spots will give youearthen clayand other archaeologymaterialsthat can be stored in the nearbymaterial storage container. once you've retrieved both pieces of the beacon, return to thetree of balance. when you show the pieces of the beacon to it, it will combine the two pieces into thedamaged soul beacon, but will state that the beacon lies dormant. he advises you to restore the relic at anarchaeologist's workbench(there is one in thearchaeology campusto the north). multiplyglyphscan be used to increase the number of the required greater ensouled bars produced by rituals. you will need level 86archaeologyto restore the damaged soul beacon into asoul beacon. bring the restored soul beacon back to the tree of balance, who will noticemisalionar's message that had been left on the soul beacon as instructions. the message is as follows: ""for cursed souls who have undergone change at an elemental level, may this beacon allow one to commune with them, cleanse them, and change their fate"". the tree of life will ask you the four glyphs indicated by this message, and you need to answer correctly  to proceed. the glyphs correspond to the words appearing in the message in order; the first glyph is change, second elemental, third commune, and fourth change again. after answering correctly, return todeathin thecity of um. death will admire the focus briefly, before informing you that the ritual to cleansevorkath's soul will need to be completed twice. first, at theum ritual siteto create an anchor point to draw vorkath's soul, and second, near vorkath on the surface at theungael ritual site. death will send you to perform the first ritual. head over to the ritual site and use thepedestalin the centre to select thesoulfarerritual. the ritual has the following requirements: when the ritual concludes, you will retrieve the soul beacon back. now, you must return toungaelto perform the second ritual there. return toungaelvia therowboatnext to thegrovecabin, and make sure to bringarmour,food, andweapons, along with the materials needed to perform thesoulfarerritual a second time. head back through thecolossal caveto wherevorkathis hiding. just to the east of the cliff is an ancient ritual site that can now be repaired. repair theancient ritual pedestal,ancient ritual platform,ruined glyphs, andruined platforms(13 total objects). this requires no materials, and grants 0.5experienceinconstructionfor each object. start thesoulfarerritual once again at your newly constructed ritual site and prepare for a combat encounter. as you step up to perform the ritual, a cutscene will begin. three entities will approach the ritual site:bilrach, amysterious relic, andvengeance. vengeance will note that the reports of vorkath's presence were correct before noticing you at the ritual site. you will express bewilderment at bilrach's appearance, as you had previously believed him dead atmoia's hands. the group will approach vorkath, stating that vorkath's purpose is something far greater thanzemouregalhad intended. they use the mysterious relic to begin siphoning energy from vorkath and the dark power within him, causing the dragon severe pain. bilrach will oversee the siphoning, sending vengeance to deal with you so you won't interfere. vengeance will attack you with melee periodically. whenever this happens, defeat vengeance, and continue the ritual. if you should die during this portion of the quest, it is a safe death. while performing the ritual,shadow riftswill also spawn, which you must close to continue the ritual. once the ritual is completed, bilrach will inform you that it's too late, and that your interference failed. vorkath will collapse to the ground, unmoving, and the intruders will all teleport away. the beacon on the ritual pedestal will flash and vanish, leaving you alone with vorkath's corpse. approach vorkath on the cliff and inspect his body. he will be completely unresponsive, and there is no trace of his soul. you decide to head tocity of umand speak withdeathonce more. talk todeathincity of umand you will tell what happened onungael, sadly bemoaning your failure to rescuevorkathbeforebilrachdestroyed his soul. death will encourage you, stating that your ritual might not have been a failure. death directs you to head for the gardens to the south-east. head to the gardens just south ofseleneto find vorkath in his ghostly form napping on the grass north of thelarge cave opening. approach him to express your joy at his crossing over. vorkath cannot speak, but will acknowledge you before returning to his well-deserved rest. now thatvorkathis at peace, you decide to confrontzemouregalregarding his statements thatmoiahad killedbilrach. return to hishis cell in fort forinthry. zemouregal will express doubt at bilrach's survival, considering moia had very publicly torn him apart in front of many people. when you tell him that bilrach had an interest in vorkath's soul, zemouregal will ask you to describe in detail what you witnessed onungael. he will again express doubts at bilrach being alive, considering thatmahjarratdo not have souls to resurrect. zemouregal considers the possibility that the bilrach that appeared on ungael is not actually bilrach. when pressed, zemouregal will dismiss you, ominously telling you that this changes things, concluding the quest provided that you have the requiredbackpackspace. congratulations! quest complete! requiem for a dragon is not currently required for any

threedragonkinreleased from their prison after the events of while guthix sleeps cause havoc across gielinor. there is news of a devastating attack on mos le'harmless, and sir tiffy is quick to call you for help. rumours seem to hint towards an ancient evil, once thought to be myth, and the implications of its appearance could spell disaster for this plane. it is unclear what they want, and there is nothing to say why they have risen now. yet, with one threat comes another: the planets have aligned, signalling the ritual of the mahjarrat. these mighty and ambitious beings are looking to draw the life from one of their order, sacrificing them to regain lost energies and add flesh to bones. the ritual will also offer near-limitless power to a single mahjarrat who has already been gathering superhuman strength and influence. with an arsenal of weapons taken from the gods, could the ritual be your last opportunity to stop him before he achieves complete domination? with two monumental threats such as these, humanity risks being utterly crushed. fighting now would require armies of bold and fearless warriors, yet only a precious few are able to stand up and face them. the question is: are you ready to join the defence of runescape? word of an attack on the isle of mos le'harmless has reached the ears of sir tiffy cashien. should you choose to accept his request, you will be sent to aid sir tendeth who has come across a great threat to the world; one far greater than the pirates he was originally sent to investigate. do you have the stomach to investigate this new threat, and see it through to the end? or will you leave the world to its doom while you cower in fear? it is wise to read ahead before you start a new chapter so you know what's coming. speak tosir tiffy cashieninfalador park. select the ""ritual of the mahjarrat"" option and ask if there are any new missions or anything you can help with. sir tiffy will comment that you have good timing and tell you that he has an operative onmos le'harmless, who is gathering information about an attack on human settlements and has been asking for assistance. he tells you to go tothe other innand ask forsir tendeth, who is undercover and dressed like a pirate. finish talking to sir tiffy, and when you say you'll ""get right on it"", you'll be given an offer to be teleported to mos le'harmless. if you don't accept the offer to be teleported now, you will not be able to request it later and will have to travel to mos le'harmless another way. go to mos le'harmless to find sir tendeth. if you have marked ritual of the mahjarrat as youractive quest, the entire island will be highlighted. sir tendeth, however, will be in the larger of the two pubs, dressed like a pirate and wielding a dagger. ask if the pirates are planning to attack cities, and tendeth will assure you that pirates are only a threat to other ships. he will tell you that what he has been investigating is a threat to everything, up to and including fortified cities. a dialogue will appear which warns that the mos le'harmless jungle is about to become significantly more difficult to get around and will remain that way until the conclusion of this part of the quest. if you wish to continue, a screech will be heard, and, with ominous music, a short cutscene will begin. be warned: the screen shakes quite violently during this cutscene, so please be mindful if you are sensitive to these effects. the screen will start shaking and flashes of fire will be seen outside the inn. when things clear up, speak to sir tendeth again, and he will tell you to look outside to see if anyone saw anything while he calms his nerves. speaking with the injured pirates lying outside the pub reveals that they were attacked with fireballs but not much else. speak with more pirates to reveal that some sort of firebreathing dragon-like beings went flying into the jungle to the northeast. reports from the pirates as to what happened will vary. the injured pirate to the south will tell you that something threw a fireball at him, but he didn't see what did it. the injured pirate to the north will have no information. other pirates will say they saw things like giant fire-breathing albatrosses, bony dragons that stood like men and could speak, enormous vultures and giant bats. the player may choose to head toward the jungle at any point, but either way, after questioning enough pirates, you will think ""hmm, i'd best go and check things out""). you'll want to take weapons and armour with you before heading into the jungle, as it is populated by aggressivejungle horrors. sir tendeth suggests you take a look out of the gate to see what is happening out there. he will join you as you leave, but a fireball will hit and kill him before you can do anything. clicking inside the village walls during the cutscene will end the scene, but it will be restarted upon re-entering the jungle. at the end of the cutscene you'll duck for cover on the west side of a nearby tropical tree. you'll then decide to run to the origin of the fireballs, using the trees as cover. the tall jungle grass also provides cover, up until you are north oftrouble brewing, then you must use the trees. follow the charred ground and burnt vegetation as a guide for the best path. if you remain in the open for too long you will be hit by a fireball and returned inside the village gates with some heavy damage taken. if using reasonable dragonfire protection, the damage taken should be limited to around 800-2500. if returned to the village by being hit by a fireball, you can easily restock your food and potions at the nearby bank. you can recover health simply by standing in the bank, which greatly reduces the need for food and may remove the need for dragonfire protection. you should disableauto-retaliateto avoid moving out of cover when attacked by the hordes of jungle horrors. also, it will aid you to orient your camera view to the north, and zoom out all the way. small and large trees may be used to hide behind, but use caution around clusters of grasses as you may accidentally click into an open area, thus being hit by a fireball. wait a second or two before moving to the next tree, otherwise the game will assume you didn't reach a safe point and fireballs will strike you seemingly randomly. furthermore, if a fireball is heading your way, there is unfortunately no way to duck out of its way; this is your extended knockout animation. the music changes when you are out of cover, sounding something reminiscent of the jaws theme. wait for this music to end before moving out of cover (the safe music will sound slightly more like typical runescape island music). pay close attention as you near the trouble brewing minigame area, as the paths to safe cover get a bit longer and trickier. hiding behind the building to the east will not protect you, as the fireball will just go through the building end up hitting you anyway. unlike the building, the bankdeposit boxcan also be used as cover. use the following map for a safe/short route to the origin of the fireballs: if you attempt to use'rum'to reachtrouble brewing, you will be prevented from doing so, and will receive the message:an unknown power seems to prevent you from drinking this item, as tasty as it seems. once you reach the far edge of trouble brewing, in the eastern trees just northeast of the building, you will activate a cutscene. threedragonkinnamedsithaph,strisathandsakirthwill be discussing how destruction eases ""the rage"" and say that it is still building, and that someone must be using ""it"". they decide to attack a larger settlement and that they must continue their search for the ""false user"". they then fly off, and you say you must report back to sir tiffy. if you log out during or accidentally click out of this conversation, return to the penultimate hiding spot shown on the map above, then return to the last. this resets the process and triggers the cutscene to begin again. return to falador park and speak to sir tiffy about the ritual of the mahjarrat. tell him what you saw and he will take you to the temple knight archives where you will meet withlady table. lady table will produce a dossier on the dragonkin. she says it's mostly compiled of 'sightings' reports, similar to those on the 'reprehensible snowgre'. a note fromrobert the strongwill be found in the dossier, saying that the ""stonetoucher"" must take the collar from hisreincarnationand use it to get tokethsi, and then as a puzzle key once they get there. tell lady table and sir tiffy that robert was reincarnated asbob the cat, and that you've researched this for an earlieradventure. also tell them that you think you're the stonetoucher, because of what happened duringyour previous missionwith the white knights. lady table tells you to go find bob and get his collar. exit the archive via the door to the east and you will be given the option to travel with sir tiffy back to falador. next, use the tracking capability of your catspeak amulet (e) to locate bob and acquire hiscollar. to use the amulet, right-click on it and select open. usually, the eyes immediately light up, and one of the diamond-like shapes surrounding the head lights up; this light points the direction that you must go to find bob. if the amulet does not automatically light up, the two whiskers can be clicked to rotate the triangular nose in the centre, lighting a new diamond. rotate the nose until the eyes light up, and the diamond-shaped light will be pointing in the direction that will take you to bob. as shown on the catspeak amulet interface, north is pointed upward. keep this in mind as you begin travelling to search for bob. once the eyes light up in the amulet interface, try teleporting somewhere in the general direction that the amulet is pointing (similar to searching for acompassclue scroll). continue checking the amulet and teleporting and walking around until you find him. bob's location is different for everyone because of his movement around runescape, being foundanywhereon the surface of runescape that is not blocked by a physical barrier between it andunferth's house. once you find bob, ask for his collar and he will give it to you. study bob's collar by clicking on it. the front side shows ""bob"", but flip it over (using the arrow button) to find ""diraks"" on the back. players familiar withfairy ringcoordinates may recognise this anagram as a combination fairy ring code. using a fairy ring, teleport todirfollowed byaks, and you will arrive at kethsi. once there, begin exploring to discover the motives behind the dragonkin attack. in order to do this, you must collect the fourtetrahedronsfound scattered around the isle of kethsi, which together form the crest of the overwhelmingly powerful dragonkin. once you arrive at kethsi, before doing anything else begin by heading to the northwestern corner of the island, and search the rubble beneath the flooring in order to obtain thetetrahedron 4. next, go south east and up on to the ramp nearby onto the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]of the destroyed building. now go north and use bob's collar on thewall design. you will need to position bob's collar correctly into the pattern of the wall design order to open a concealed compartment. this is done by positioning the collar vertically, with the ""bob"" side face up, in between the centre-right and far right piece. once the collar is in this position, you must move it up until it slots into place. you will then receive five items. two notes (note to robert the strongandnote to you),tetrahedron 1, astatue armandrobert's necklace. the necklace plays no role in the quest and may be banked the next time you are at one, or destroyed and later recollected fromkethsiormay's quest caravan. this is where you will be needing the level 77 agility requirement, and can not continue the quest without it, and boosts can not be used to reach it. thesurefooted aurawill not guarantee success with kethsi's agility obstacles. staying on the same floor, go south and then jump across the ledge to the west. use the statue arm you acquired from the hidden compartment on the statue with one arm. a spire will then fall. cross this spire and then go down the ladder in front of you. head east and up the wall jump shortcut, which you can run up. once up, climb the wall to the west, followed by taking the swing-pole to the north. walk across the beam to the east, and jump over the gap, go south and jump-from floor on south, and go down the two ladders. now, squeeze through the pipe to the east of you. mine the rockslide that is blocking the path to the north. climb up the wall in the north and cross the two walls and a set of handholds to get to a set of ladders in the west corner. if you fall on the way, you will need to run around to the south-east corner of the island and continue from the pipe obstacle. go down the ladder, go north outside of the building then east and search some rubble for astrange deviceandtetrahedron 3. return to the ladder, climb it, and climb up the second one as well. jump from the floor to the south (it is possible to fail this jump and start over again). slide-down the roof to the south and then go south, taking the spade beside the stairs, and walk across the plank. search the nearby rubble to find the final piece of the puzzle,tetrahedron 2. once you've found all four (4) tetrahedrons, go back across the plank and go down the stairs. in the dungeon, use all your tetrahedrons on the ""indentations"" in the walls on either side of the stairs. to receive symbols 1, 2, 3, and 4, which make up a 4 letter code. your code will be listed in your quest journal, but you can also use the following checklist to help reference it quicker. the basic objective is to locate your code from the wall indentations listed in your quest journal with your strange device somewhere in kethsi. as you move throughout the map, the strange device will list different coordinates in which you can use the map below to make more sense of it. your object now is to search the plane of kethsi, using the strange device to find the location that matches your code. when you find the correct location, you will use your spade to dig in that spot. there is a spade outside at the top of the stairs, as well as inside in the base of the stairs if you didn't bring one earlier. refer to the map above to find your location (many of the common coordinates have been digitised on the map to help locate your specific set of coordinates faster). the spot to dig can be a few tiles around the spots seen on the map, but can be corrected manually with the strange device. if you prefer more of a challenge, use the strange device to help find the coordinates as you interpret the map above. coordinates start in the southwest corner of the map ataaaa. every cell on the map represents a ""major"" grid cell, and is lettered a through h along eight (8) columns and rows. imagine that every ""major"" grid cell is also divided into ""minor"" cells a through h; eight (8) columns and rows per ""major"" grid cell. the first two letters of your code represent the ""major"" and ""minor"" columns, respectively. the last two letters of your code represent the ""major"" and ""minor"" rows, respectively. for example, seeeagaon the map above. notice thateagalies nearly directly on the intersection of the major grid lines, because its minor coordinates areaa. now findfcgcand notice that it lies ""floating"" near the centre of major grid cellfg, because its minor grid cell coordinates arecc. it may be easiest to teleport out of kethsi, and then back to it using fairy ring codesdirandaksagain; this will help you avoid having to pass through the agility obstacles more than necessary. once you have found your spot, dig there with a spade, and you'll find akethsian key. go back to the dungeon on the west island, and use the key to get through the southern door. search the bookcase at the southeast corner of the library for ascroll. read the scroll to learn a new spell,tune banite ore. search the bookcase west of it and read thejournal. return to falador and report to sir tiffy with the journal (dathana's message). he will read it and the information will worry him a lot. he suggests you visitidria,thaeriskandakrisaein falador castle. do so and speak to any of the three. tell them what you have discovered from dathana's message: the dragonkin grow more powerful as the power of thestone of jasis used. and now that lucien is using the stone a lot, the dragonkin may become powerful to a degree that they may destroy all ofgielinor. idria will be very concerned and, as always, akrisae will be skeptical. suddenly,ali the wisewill show up and contribute additional information. his research and knowledge of astronomy have pointed out that themahjarratritual of rejuvenationis about to commence. this seems like another problem to akrisae, but ali is able to make a plan out of it. since lucien will definitely be using the stone at the ritual, and several other mahjarrat have the desire to dispatch him, you may ally yourselves with said mahjarrat to counter the combined power of the stone, the staff of armadyl and lucien and defeat him. akrisae will need convincing that having the aid of the mahjarrat is necessary, for he believes all of them are as evil as lucien. so begins a ""chat puzzle"". incorrect answers while speaking with akrisae will cause you to lose progress one step at a time, forcing you to try again with each step. when the option is available, sarcastically ask him if he wants everyone on the planet to die (""so, instead, you'd risk all our lives?""), to which he will respond more calmly. he suggests there must be another possibility, and you must convince him there isn't (""'i can't think of another way.""). he will calm down some more, but remain skeptical. from here, you'll need to agree with him to remain cautious in an association with the mahjarrat (""yes, we'll have to be careful.""). finally, he'll say that he won't be the one to negotiate, to which you should tell him that you will do the work (""i will risk my own life to negotiate."") thaerisk proposes that someone scout the area of the ritual beforehand. ali the wise mentions oneghorrock fortressthat serves as a gateway to the ritual site, and you will suggest that this fortress is the one at thefrozen waste plateau, which you infiltrated inthe temple at senntisten. akrisae will give you four (4)teleorbs, to try to teleport the stone of jas away from the ritual site. ali will suggest thatzemouregalwill probably usearravduring the ritual, and gives youarrav's heart, telling you that you should hide it at the ritual site and use it later to try to break zemouregal's control of arrav. finally, ali will suggest speaking withazzanadra, as he will likely be the group's closest ally during the ritual. head to thetemplethrough the varrock dig site. once at the temple, talk toazzanadrausing theritual of the mahjarratchat option. he will be surprised that you know of the ritual and his intent to attend, and assumes that ali must have told you for a good reason. you will tell him of the proposed alliance, of lucien, and of the stone. he will reveal that his spies have informed him of lucien's possession of the staff, but that he himself is not familiar with the stone. you will briefly explain it to him and he will give you another task. azzanadra has stored some ofzaros' power in fourbeacons, which he asks you to place at the ritual site, specifying that the northern and southern beacons must directly face each other, and likewise the eastern and western ones as well, and that they also should be positioned in a high place, to project the godly power of zaros to defeat lucien. it is now time to head to the fortress. travel toghorrock, the site on which theritualwill take place. it is recommended to travel by thecanoenext toerjolfin thesnowy hunter areaas this bypasses thewilderness, for example by use of thefremennik provincelodestone, thefairy ringcodedks, or thearctic bearfamiliarteleport. go up the hill from the canoe to ghorrock, pass the ice block on the western wall and enter the outer walls of the fortress, then enter the inner walls by the southern arch. thesteelandiron dragonsarenon-aggressive, and shouldn't pose a problem for you if you don't accidentally click them. climb up the western staircase and then back down on the east, scale up the damaged wall and finally climb back down thesmashed rampart on the west (not the east ones)to reach the trapdoor to ghorrock dungeon. there are far moreicefiendsandwaterfiendsthan there were in the previous quests. (this is because thefrostenhornwas taken, and with it the dungeon became more hostile.) these monsters prove dangerous to even high-level players due to sheer numbers and the quickness of their attacks. run to the south-western corner and pick up the heat globe on the floor, and then run back and ascend the stairs. circle back around to exit the inner walls, and jump over the pillar immediately to the south. enter the tunnel to theritual plateau. once on the open plain, you'll noticeundead broavswandering around. these should be avoided, because if one sees you, awizardwill appear and teleport you to a cell insidezemouregal's fort. they have a rather short range of view so as long as you're a little bit careful they shouldn't be much of a problem at all. if you do get sent to the cell, you can lift a tile in the east and dig a hole, then climb through it to be placed just outside of the fort. you can do the section of the quest that takes placeinside the fortwhile you are there, if you want to, but remember to prepare the ritual site after. you will now have to place several items which will aid the allies in battle around the ritual site. you will place the four beacons in four trees located on the edges of the ritual plateau. the green dots on the above map of the ritual site are the locations of the beacon trees. you can increase your draw distance in settings (options>settings>graphicstab >draw distance) to view opposite beacons on screen, if that helps. you also need to find a place to hide arrav's heart, and let down a rope from the ritual plateau down to the beach near the fortress, allowing your allies to reach the ritual site. from the tunnel you emerge from, head west, past the corner of the fortress wall. there is an overhanging tree just next to a cavern entrance (dungeon icon on minimap), where you can tie the rope. slightly back the way you came, just at the southwest corner of the wall, are two trees. use a beacon on the eastern one to place the beacon there. now run directly south to find a second tree, immediately to the northeast of a pile of icy rocks, and south-west of the ritual marker. place the second beacon in it. if this is done correctly, a dialogue will appear saying""you place the beacon. it is directly opposite the beacon to the north.""you should also hide arrav's heart in the pile of rocks just northeast of this tree, directly south of the ritual marker. then head west to a forest of evergreen trees, run north towards the corner of the forest and place the beacon in the large tree just before reaching the corner. now you need to place its partner, so head directly east. if the raised platform of the ritual marker is in the way, go around it to the north. the tree for the final beacon is the third from the northeast corner. you should again get a message saying that you have correctly placed it directly opposite the western beacon. the fort is directly west-southwest of the ritual site, behind the forest. running up to a broav can be a convenient way of getting there. you will be put into a cell. search the bed for a chisel and spade. use the chisel on the floor tile, then dig with the spade. when you are outside the entrance, kill thearmoured zombieand pick up thecode key (main entrance)anddecoder strips. as with other quests involvingzemouregal, you must use decoder strips to unlock a door that utilises adecoder puzzleas its lock. in this case, the door you must open is the main entrance to zemouregal's fort. begin by reading the code key, which will give you a code of four letters; for example 'eihc' (see the image to the left). click the main entrance door to begin decoding the lock. within the puzzle interface, you'll have your decoder strips shown on the right side, and a series of code numbers organised by letters on the left. beginning with decoder strip 1, drag-and-drop (you may also select a strip and use the four-way arrows to move) the decoder strip onto the first letter of the code revealed in the code key. (for example, using 'eihc' as our code, you would place decoder strip 1 on the 'e' row). the first code number needed to unlock the door will show through the slot in the decoder strip (for example, the number 6 in the above image). use the 'up' and 'down' arrows in the middle of the interface to cycle through available numbers, and use the 'right' and 'left' arrows to respectively submit or delete a number from the combination slots at the top of the interface. repeat this process using all of the decoder strips to decode the lock and enter the fort. the four decoder strips in the interface are used to decode each digit of the code, and you must use all four of them. that is, the same letter in different positions does not correspond to the same number. when the correct code has been input, the door will unlock. enter the base and search the crate adjacent to the northeastern weapon rack to find thestoreroom code key. again, read the code and use it to open the western storeroom door, using the same process as before. search the crates in the north room of the storeroom to get areliquary code keyand somenotes. read them to discover that zemouregal has had some trouble maintaining power overarrav. in order to strengthen his power, he created a glass prism, but it wasn't enough. he finally created an obsidian prism, and it works well, though is quite fragile. with this useful information, go back into the main room and climb the westernmost stairs. walk down the hallway; zemouregal and sharathteerk are in the room to the west. if you stand in front of both of the locked doors, you'll overhear them discussing their plans: their zombie army is full strength and arrav is in position. surprisingly, zemouregal will say that he ""can sense your presence"" and ""has spotted an intruder"". hilariously, this turns out only to be him ""practising for the ritual"", and you'll remain safely hidden. go back down the stairs, and this time go up the eastern stairs. use the code key and strips to enter the reliquary. once inside, smash theblack stonein the south of the room. this will weaken zemouregal's control over arrav, which will benefit you and your allies during the ritual. once finished, go back down the stairs and leave the fort. run over tomovario, at the southeastern corner of the plateau. the broavs can interrupt your conversation with him. speak with him to learn that he senses thestone of jasnearby, aslucienis planning on using it during the ritual. furthermore, he sensesshadow magicthat may be in use, hiding the stone. ensure you are wearing thering of visibility, and run west along the south side to find an invisible shadow pedestal (the pedestal can be seen but not used until you've spoken with movario). investigate the pedestal and your character will note that it's similar to the ones inghorrock. place the heat globe on the pedestal, and some nearby ice will melt to reveal a cave entrance. warning:if you are not fully prepared for the upcoming fight, return to a bank and prepare before entering! dying during the upcoming fights will place yourgravestoneoutside ghorrock, near the entrance to theritual site cavern. climb the rope to retry. if your respawn point is set to edgeville or varrock, running to the nearestfairy ringand using codedksto return to your grave should return you to the cave within two minutes. however, a bug has been reported where even if you get back to your gravestone, it may not allow you to recover anything. if you try to put heat globe on the shadow pedestal and a dialogue appears which says, ""that could be a good idea, but you've got other things to do first."", it means either your beacons are not aligned properly, arrav's heart has not been placed yet, you haven't talked to movario after smashing the prism, or you forgot to put the rope on the overhanging tree in the north-west corner. if you are completely sure the beacons are in their correct alignment, talk to movario once more, and he will place the heat globe on the pedestal. some players have removed and replaced a beacon from a tree and have reported that this worked for them. some report that reading the heart notes/dathana's message will also fix this. it is recommended to keep your codes on you as well, as the glitch may occur if you destroy them during this section. try approching the globe from movario's direction with the wildy and movario at your back. prepare yourself for the final fight. pass through the entrance you opened in the south on the plateau. you will be in a large ice cavern. the passage to the east is blocked by an energy barrier that cannot be passed at this time. go down the other passage and... thestone of jaswill be there! touch it to trigger a vision of the past, like duringwhile guthix sleeps. the fortress ofannakarl, which is now known as thedemonic ruins, will be shown in the year 3100 of thethird age- the last part of the god wars.zamorakianandsaradoministforces are engaged in a huge battle.commander zilyanais seen facing the huge zamorakian demon,k'ril tsutsaroth. as they battle, k'ril gets the upper hand and blasts zilyana away, mortally wounding her. he takes a final look at her unconscious body and departs.saradominhimself comes to rescue her and takes her to thefist of guthix arena, where the stone of jas lies, and heals her. he shows her the stone of jas (which he calls the eye of saradomin), and tells her that zamorak returned from his banishment and started a war in order to reclaim it and it was the most prominent tool he used to attain godhood. commander zilyana vs. k'ril tsutsaroth. k'ril leaves zilyana for dead. saradomin arrives to save commander zilyana. saradomin uses the stone of jas. your combat stats will be boosted by the stone of jas so you should not usesaradomin brewsor stat boosting potions. you should bring the best weapon and armour that you have for your chosen attack style and good food (monkfish or better), and you may want to bring abeast of burden, prayer potions, and an emergency teleport. you are able to leave after each battle. if you die during a battle, your grave will either appear near the rope on the tree west of the entrance to the plateau or insideghorrock. at the end of the cutscene, an alarm will begin, alerting the mahjarrat to your presence. you will be teleported outside, to findsir tiffy,akrisae,ali the wise, and a battalion oftemple knights. according to ali, the ritual is about to commence and the ritual plateau is flooded with fighting mahjarrat. you will head for the ritual site, but will be intercepted bygeneral khazardand sixelite khazard guards. he will reveal the true identity of ali the wise: the mahjarratwahisietel. naturally, akrisae will begin to panic, but you and wahisietel will calm him down. general khazard will then proceed to attack you. your combat stats will be boosted significantly throughout the final battles due to your contact with the stone. as such, you will be able to hit significantly higher than you normally can, and your summoning familiars damage will be boosted too. because of the boosts received from the stone it is recommended to not usesaradomin brewsto heal, as they will lower your bonuses. if using ranged or magic, khazard will use a long-rangemagicattack, which can be blocked with theprotect from magicordeflect magicprayers. if using melee, khazard will also fight with melee, which you can useprotect from meleeto protect against.sir tiffyandwahisietelaid you in attacking khazard, and the temple knights attack his minions. periodically throughout the fight, khazard will summon his hellhoundbouncer, who will constantly inflict "

the ninth and final quest in themyreque quest series. it was first announced atrunefest 2015and released on25 april2016. the quest features vanescula and the vampyres having discovered a way to cross theriver salve, and the player trying to find a way to stop a war occurring between misthalin and the vampyres. the focal point of the quest ispaterdomus, which was graphically updated ahead of the quest's release. the release of river of blood was preceded by the release of other vampyre content, includingthe lost toysminiquest and thein memory of the myreque miniquest. as with the in memory of the myreque miniquest, river of blood was subject to anearly bird bonuswhere players who completed the quest before8 may2016received increased experience rewards from it.[1] speak withking roaldin thevarrock palaceabout the situation inmorytania. he will dispatch you,aeonisig, and the varrock guard topaterdomus. head to paterdomus' mausoleum and talk todrezel. after speaking with drezel, aeonisig and the guard will have arrived. go to the paterdomusbeacon, which is south of thepaterdomus, and speak with aeonisig who warns of the approachingvyrewatch. help the varrock guard defeat the vampyres, then talk to aeonisig again. inside the church there will be 5monks of zamorak(level 23) and another 5 on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]. after killing all 10 a dialogue option will appear suggesting you go to the top floor. after climbing the stairs to the top floor a cutscene will start where the player will interrupt and catch azamorakian leaderand azamorakian bodyguard, both level 98. the bodyguard uses ranged and the leader uses magic and can use abilities for their respective styles. once killed, they will drop a book,the covenant of perpetual conflict. a dialogue option will appear saying that you should let aeonisig know. speak tocaptain rovin, situated just north-east of aeonisig. he will suggest that his guards need to be armed with three sets ofsteel armour: each set of armour will consist of asteel med helm(not to be confused with thesteel full helm), asteel platebody, andsteel platelegs(notplateskirt). the player will suggest that the guards should be armed withblisterwoodweaponry, for which the guard will also request twoblisterwood sicklesand ablisterwood polearm. thereafter, talking to captain rovin will prompt a dialogue box, showing each and every item needed, the quantity in the player's inventory and whether the player wants to hand over the items to him. selecting ""yes"" arms all of the guards and prompts the player to speak to aeonisig. head toivan stromin paterdomus' mausoleum. after talking to ivan, the player will be involved in a short dialogue with drezel dismissing a plan because it was assumed to bezamorakianpropaganda. after the dialogue the player will be directed to search through the library to find a book on reversing vampyrism. climb down the nearby trapdoor to get to the library. the bookcases must be interacted with in order for a total of 7 steps. if a bookcase is pulled out of order the sequence must be restarted. the order of cities (in the titles of the books) is: once the blood of the covenant has been obtained, the player has to return to ivan. now the player is directed to find the tomb ofivandis seergazeto see if he left behind any clues or notes. it is important not to forget theguthix balancepotion here. the tomb is found in the secretmyreque hideouttunnels underneathcanifis(accessed via the trapdoor behind thehair of the dog, then the first cave to the east). players who have unlocked the trapdoor short-cut by levelling zachory bragg to level 99 will have to toggle this off at thetemple trekkingnoticeboard (not the one inburgh de rott) to continue. alternatively, thefairy ringdlswill take you to the tunnels, go through the cave with the spiders and rats, then enter the cave just north of you. the tomb is located in the north-east cave entrance close to a wall that is searchable. once at the tomb, the guthix balance potion should be used on the tomb to unlock it. upon searching it the player receives ascroll case, asilvthril bar,ivandis's serum, and some notes. the scroll case should be opened and the diary pages should be used on the blood of the covenant to complete the book. then read thescroll of balanceto reveal the recipe for thesuper guthix balancepotion. return to ivan and he will instruct you to make the potion revealed in the recipe received from the scroll case. the silvthril bar should be ground down using the grinder on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]of theectofuntusto makesilvthril dust. use the silvthril dust on the altar of nature in thenature grottoto bless it, obtainingsilvthril dust (b). the fastest way to the nature grotto is unlocked from temple trekking: reach the swamp gate (fairy ringcks) and use ""quick travel"" to instantly reach the grotto. the nature grotto can also be reached by usingdrakan's medallionto teleport tobarrowsorburgh de rott, and heading north-west.blisterwood logsshould be cut from the tree and burned.blisterwood ashesshould appear as soon as the fire is lit. once all the ingredients have been gathered, use any of the required items on another one to make asuper guthix balancepotion. don't get rid of ivandis's serum as you will need it later in the quest. return to ivan. after a short dialogue, use the potion on the well. you will then be prompted to speak to aeonisig. after returning to aeonisig with all three stages complete, you will be notified thatvanescula drakanhas arrived. head there through either the mausoleum or the agility shortcut, and try to convince her to call off the attack since the salve was strengthened. however she does not believe it is enough and proceeds to send fourvampyre juvinatesto attack. the juvinates will turn intoferal vampyresonce they step over the salve, one of which runs away leaving you to fight the other three. the feral vampyres are fairly weak, possessing the same stats as those in thegod wars dungeon, and can be defeated without the use ofblisterwood weapons. once all the feral vampyres are defeated, speak to vanescula, and you will soon be interrupted by a giant vyre known as awyrd, wearing some familiar attire. vanescula will demand it return tocastle drakan, but she is seemingly unable to control it. it proceeds to attack drezel, and will then attack you and ivan. it has 100,000 life points, and has two special attacks, which are announced via a popup notification, a ""sonic attack"", which can be avoided by running away from it, and a blood attack, which can be avoided by running from the pool of blood that spawns. to avoid the sonic attack you must have at least two squares between you and the wyrd to avoid getting hit. if you do not avoid the sonic attack, it will deal 7,500 melee damage.protect from meleeworks against the sonic attack and when used withdevotion, can completely negate it.resonancecan also be quite useful for this fight as it will block the one hit kill from the sonic attack and will absorb the 3,000+ hit from the blood geyser if timed correctly. as with most vampyres, it is only vulnerable to theivandis flailand blisterwood. because it mainly attacks with melee, it is recommended to use magic, though melee works well too. if you die your tombstone will be on the paterdomus bridge. if you run too far from the wyrd, it will teleport you next to it; note that while rare, it is possible to be teleported outside of the fight area, causing the instance to end and requiring the fight to be restarted. it may be helpful to pray melee and remain next to it until it uses one of its special attacks. once you have defeated it,efaritaywill appear and scare it off, with vanescula and her army following soon after. efaritay will explain that the creature was awyrd, and thatdrezelwill soon die from his wound. he dies soon after, and entrusts ivan with protecting the temple in his stead. efaritay then heads off to theicyene graveyardand tells you to meet her there if you wish. the varrockian army vanescula's army after efaritay leaves, she can be found at theicyene graveyardwhich is accessed from the boat south-east ofburgh de rottor over the agility shortcut from theeverlight dig site. after a short conversation in which you explain that her sonsafalaanhas died, she asks you to retrieve herpendantfrom the crypt, inspect queen efaritay on the crypt to retrieve the pendant. speak to her again, and you will come to the conclusion that safalaan did not die, and is in actuality the wyrd that you fought earlier, since he shouldn't have died from vanescula biting him. she will then ask you for help in reforging thesunspear, which can be done by using ablisterwood shaft(made from ablisterwood log), thewolfbanedagger, and the tip of the sunspear on each other. wolfbane may be obtained by right-clickingivan stromand selecting ""reclaim"" at no charge. once reforged, the sunspear becomes a level 78 two-handed weapon which can be switched between amelee spear, aranged javelin, and amagic staff. once the sunspear is reforged, the efaritay suggests that the player hunts down the wyrd to try and gather itsbloodto create the cure for vampyrism. you're directed to go to themeiyerditch laboratories; this can be done quickly usingdrakan's medallion. once there, talk tosarius guileand try to find herfather'sresearch. thehidden journalis found on an interactable research table in the north end of the cave withmutated bloodveld. once it is found, read, and returned to sarius, she instructs you thatrefined daeyaltis needed. enter themeiyerditch mine, a short distance to the north-west of the laboratories, marked on the minimap by dungeon and mine icons. talk to one of the juvinate guards and ask where the refinery is. if wearing thehouse drakan outfit, the juvinate guard will inform you that a slave is about to fill a cart and you can push that in once it is full. if you do not have the outfit, you must mine 15daeyalt oreto fill the mine cart. once the cart is full, the guard will take you to the refinery where there will be 3 juvinate guards to defeat. it is possible to use ranged or magic and trap the juvinate guards behind the pool. after, the player should free the 5burgh de rottprisoners who will proceed into the next room. each lock will damage you for one-tenth of your maximum health, so make sure you have enough to survive. in the next room, inspect each blood lock and talk to the prisoners, they will tell you which emotion the tithe should display. once you've talked to all of them, go to the remaining shadum blood lock and choose the ""i accept my fate and put my hand in the machine"" option. this will turn off the refinery so you can collect therefined daeyalt. once therefined daeyalthas been gathered, inspect the rejuvenation tank andsafalaanwill jump out and poisons you after refusing to help you. the rest of this section of the quest involves combat, and the final fight is quite difficult, involving several previous boss fights consecutively. you can attempt to use lodestones and you will be prompted whether you want to leave; you can use this to heal or restock, and pushing the cart in the daeyalt mine will take you back, with your progress saved. you will then begin hallucinating, and can proceed to climb up the stairs in pursuit of safalaan. proceed through the room, and you will encounter hallucinations of sevenskeleton hellhounds, like the onesvanstrom klausesummoned duringin search of the myreque. defeat them in order to proceed. once the 7 skeletal hellhounds are defeated, the barrier over the exit fades and you can progress onward upstairs. head through the warped rooms and their bizarre decorations, go to the library and pick upvertida's bottle of holy water. continue through the halls past the shattering windows, and you will encounterharold, vanstrom's petbloodveldfromthe branches of darkmeyer. dispatch him by throwing the holy water at him and continue onwards, past what appears to be thegrand exchange. climb to the next floor and you will find ablisterwood treeand thestone of jas. you may interact with the stone of jas to hear memories of vanescula andlowernieltalking about it, but nothing interesting happens when you touch it. interact with the barrel of gunpowder to see hallucinations ofkael forshawandandiess juiptelling you that you'll need something flammable first. cut one blisterwood log from the tree, and use it to light the fire pit in front of the stone of jas. then push the keg of gunpowder over it to blow up the stone, causing debris to land everywhere. walk past it and head into the room with the blood puzzle. simply click the outer ring once to solve it, and then head up to the roof. note:should you die during the final fight, you will safely respawn at the darkmeyerarboretum. you may return to the roof by using the front gate of castle drakan, or by going through the daeyalt mine and pushing the cart. you must defeat all stages of this fight without dying in order to progress. speak tosafalaan, andefaritaywill appear to try and help restore his sanity. he will exclaim his hatred and desire to kill both of you. safalaan will then begin to attack her, and reduce her life points rather quickly. take advantage of the time where he's not focused on you to get in some easy damage. this battle is safe; if you die, you will retain your items, but progress is not saved until all forms are defeated. once safalaan has reduced efaritay's life points, he will begin attacking you. as with before, you may only damage him with theivandis flail,blisterwood weapons, thestandard sunspear, oryour reforged sunspear. it is recommended to use the sunspear, as it is extremely powerful against vampyres, and hits of 10,000 or more are possible using ultimate abilities. safalaan will attack with melee and none of the special abilities from the earlier fight, and is fairly simple to defeat. once his life points are reduced to about 3/4, you will begin hallucinating that he isvanstrom klause. vanstrom uses magical attacks, and will often teleport you and himself somewhere else in the arena, creating a blood pool that you must run away from unless you wish to receive a large hit of magic damage. when you have ""killed"" vanstrom, you will continue fighting safalaan with the health he had remaining, and this time he will also use his blood geyser and sonic special attacks, both of which can be avoided by running away, as well as the ability to teleport you next to him frequently if you stay outside of melee range. if you are out of food and would prefer to not leave and restock, it is possible to safespot him, for example on the corner of the staircase, and use long-ranged attacks, simply running away again when he teleports you to him. he won't use his damaging special attacks while doing this. once his life points are reduced again, you will begin hallucinating that he islowerniel drakan. in this form, he will use powerful melee attacks and a special ""blood mine"" attack, which he signals by shouting ""ha ha ha!"". if the blood mines are not avoided by running away, they deal 1/4 of your maximum life points of damage each. using a hit-and-run tactic combined with the regenerate ability can again make this a safe fight. once drakan is defeated, he will turn into safalaan again, in the same way as the previous time. this is the final fight and when his health runs out, a dialogue will start with you and efaritay convincing safalaan to give you some of hiswyrd blood. adding therefined daeyaltandivandis's serumto this vial creates theextreme guthix balancepotion. give a sip of it to safalaan, and some of his sanity will be restored. take the potion back toivanin the paterdomus mausoleum, and he will suggest it be used on the well to bless the salve further. after a short ritual, the well will explode with magic lights and the salve will be strengthened once more. after strengthening the salve for the second time, return to vanescula, at the eastern exit of the mausoleum, and tell her that her army cannot pass. vanescula will say that thejuvinateswere weak but hervyrewatchwill manage to survive the salve's effects. the four vyrewatch she sends at the player will be turned to humans much to vanescula's chagrin. these humans were some of the missing persons fromburgh de rottwho went missing afterthe branches of darkmeyer;teodor,valeria,luscion, andnicoleta.safalaanarrives in wyrd form and is ordered by vanescula to attack but is instead reverted to his normal appearance. after a short dialogue the player, aeonisig, efaritay and vanescula agree to a truce. speak to vanescula once everyone leaves, and she'll tell you a story of what this defeat reminds her of, before her nobility. after her tale, she leaves you to inform king roald of the outcome. return to king roald in varrock palace to complete the quest. completing the quest between25 apriland8 may2016awarded an additional chapter in

o' piracy. to get there, you must be arrested. for this, go to thecustoms sergeantin his littleofficein southeastern rimmington. tell him you're a pirate. to trick him, you need to wear at least 3 pieces ofpirate clothing, purchasable atdodgy mike's second-hand clothingand thegrand exchange. you will have a couple of conversation pieces to convince the customs officer to arrest you. read the noticeboard next to the entrance door for information on the answers to the trick questions. the answers to the trick questions are different for everyone. if the sergeant tells you that they boarded the ship whose crew is congratulated on the noticeboard, tell him that that is one of their ships. he will then ask if you served on one of the other ships. respond appropriately depending on if the ship sank or got away. when answered correctly, you will be forced to deposit all of your items into the locker, which acts like a bank deposit box. you will be transported to jail immediately and into a humorous cutscene set in a small cell with an enormous hole in the wall byheavy-handed harry, who forbids you to escape. when you first arrive in the prison cell, all you will be wearing is aprison uniform. you do not have any items and will have to find a way to talk toyoung ralph. shout through the barred window at young ralph in the next cell.heavy-handed harrywill inform you that ralph is deaf and cannot hear you. pick up atin cupin the cell and use it on the jail door 3 times until heavy-handed harry throws stew on yourshirt, which now leaves you with afishy prison uniform top. right-click the pipe next to the jail window in your cell, select ""tap"", and you'll have an amusing morse code conversation with the prisoner in the cell below you. eventually the pipes will break, and you will receive apipe. shout-through the door to talk to heavy-handed harry and say you wish to write aconfession. you will receive aquill, anink bottle, and a piece ofpaperto write on. you can use these to write anoteto young ralph by dipping the quill in the ink to get aninky quill, then writing on the paper. attempt to give it to him by throwing it into his cell - it drops away and he doesn't see it. if you lose the paper, you can ask the guard for more. next, search for anaccordionin the rubble just outside of the jail cell. use the ink bottle on the note to make a piece of stickyinky paper. now, use the emptyink bottleon the sharp rock outside the eastern wall of the jail. use the resultantsmashed bottleon the accordion, and it will cut a small hole in it. use the pipe on the accordion, and the pipe will be pushed through the accordion. finally, use the inky paper on the accordion, to transform it into avacuum pump. use thefishy prison uniform topon the perch rock, outside your cell, to draw aseagullto sit on the perch rock. use the newly made vacuum pump on the unsuspecting seagull, and it will be trapped in it. now, use thevacuum pump and gullon young ralph's barred window. he will notice the seagull and turn around. talk to young ralph by shouting through the barred window. he will read your lips and conversation can proceed easily. at some point, harry interrupts the conversation, and you will need to whisper. you will ask about rabid jack, but he will only reveal information on him if you get marks from five captains: walk round to the pier on the east side of the island, and dive into the water. this will take you tokaramjanext tocaptain klemfoodle, a glider pilot. you will leave behind everything you carried earlier. alternatively, you can also use thehome teleport. to obtain the marks of the five captains, you must visit each of them (in any order you like) and convince them to give you the mark. speak tocaptain braindeathon theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us]of the 'rum' factory onbraindeath island(to get there, talk to pirate pete on the dock just northeast of theectofuntus). he wants you to convince thebartenderof therusty anchorinport sarimto stock his 'rum' and will give you a set of 5 disguises to wear:fake beard;fake moustache and nose;fake monocle, moustache and nose;curly wig; andstraight wig. to save time while doing this part of the quest, it is also possible to talk withredbeard frankon the port sarim docks south of the bar, which will start his portion of the quest. go tothe rusty anchor, bringing a little cash along as you need to buy a few beers. start by asking the bartender about the 'rum'. he will say they do not stock it and demand is too low to order any of it. he then explains that if 5 people were to ask for some 'rum' that would be enough demand for him to start selling it. however, the disguises captain braindeath provided will not be enough to fool him in his current state. talk to him and start getting him drunk (select the ""i'll have a drink ... and you have one too"" option or use the beer you bought on him but make sure to have 1 inventory space open). after a few drinks (about 5 should do) he will remark that he feels tired, indicating he is too drunk to recognise you in the disguises. do not talk to him again until you have a different disguise on, or you'll have to pay for another beer to get him drunk again. exit the pub (the arc journal teleport should do nicely) and put on one of the 5 disguises, then talk to him again about the rum. then, exit the pub and change disguises again. do this with all 5 disguises and, on the fifth, he will say he wants to apologise to you (meaning the original, undisguised you, who was trying to sell 'rum'). go outside and take off your disguise. talk to him yet again, and he will give you anorderfor some 'rum'. return tocaptain braindeathand give him the order. you will be givenbraindeath's markfor your efforts. if you desire to complete the achievementrusty rewardrequired for themaster quest cape, you can return to the bartender to be reimbursed the 20 coins you spent on beer. speak tobill teach; he will give you anintroduction letterand tell you to find50 ships mufassahwho is up the ladder ofthe other innon mos le'harmless, which is the most northwestern building. bill wants mufassah'sidol of many heads. traveltomos le'harmless. if you startedredbeard frank's storyline, speak tobrother tranquillityto obtain aletter. find 50 ships mufassah, located upstairs in the house north of the inn. he will then tell you how to locate the idol after you have joined his crew.brass hand harryis in the same room as 50 ships mufassah. you can save yourself a second trip by completingbrass hand's taskafter you are done talking to 50 ships mufassah. the idol is in a shipwreck off the shore ofdragontooth island. get yourdiving apparatus,fishbowl helmet(these can be obtained frommurphyinport khazardif you need replacements) andghostspeak amulet. also make sure you are not carrying too much equipment or else you'll be told you are too heavy to go diving and need to bank. 28 kg is too much, lower than 27 kg is fine. do not bring a familiar or pet with you, since you will either have to dismiss the familiar or deposit the pet into the bank (it can't be in your backpack either) before diving. go toport phasmatyswhere theghost captainwill take you to dragontooth island. remember there are 2 ghost captains - you want the one at the smaller rowboat at the south end of the docks, not the one at the bigger ship with the broken mini-ectofuntus. on the island, find thediving chain, which is in the north-east part of the island, put your diving apparatus and fishbowl helmet on and dive down. swim around until you find akaramthulhu: catch it, as its holding akeythat you will need in the next step. the karamthulhu is the only fish in the area that appears on the minimap as a yellow dot apart from the giant crabs. go aboard the ship on its north side.  there is aggressive level 70giant lobstersand non-aggressivegiant crabson the ship. they aren't particularly tough but be prepared to be attacked. go west and climb-up the stairs and open the chest (with the key in inventory) to get acrowbar. climb down the stairs and then down the ladder to the east. once on the lower deck, go west and dig the mess using the crowbar (examine mess: a pile of planks). you willlever the worst of the rotten planking out of the way with the crowbar(examine mess: a pile of sand). dig on the pile of sand untilyou scoop away a load of siltthree (3) times to eventually expose the idol. take the shiny goldenidol of many heads. (from here, you maylodestone teleportor climb to the main deck and, while standing on the deck, use yourectophial.) climb back up the ladder to the main deck, and then head back to the chain that leads to the surface. climb up the anchor (chain) to return to dragontooth island and take the boat back to port phasmatys (or use your ectophial). you may use yourectophialwhile in the water as long as you are standing on the deck of the wrecked ship. doing this will avoid having to swim back to the dive chain. you may also teleport using a lodestone straight after recovering the idol. return to bill teach and give him the idol to receivebill teach's mark. talk to captainbrass hand harryon the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]of the northern pub on mos le'harmless - the same room as50 ships mufassah. show him thebill teach'sintroduction letter, and he will state that he needs a new hand to make the mark. the task is odd, but he gives you 5broken hands, and says to use five ""broken hand pieces"" with twobronze wiresto make a hand for the mark. take apart the hands he gave you by clicking on each of them (take-apartoption). then, with the wire in your inventory, use one part of the hand with another. an interactive screen with a relatively simple puzzle appears. use the arrows to move the hand pieces to where they match on the left side (some will need to be rotated; the rotate buttons are used to flip pieces over). once it is completed, the interface automatically closes and abrass handappears in inventory. a relatively common fix if the puzzle doesn't solve is to try rotating the wrist piece until it works. also, make sure the hand appears within the blue background. talk to brass hand harry again and show him the hand. he will give you anink padand somepaper. using the brass hand on the ink pad makes it into aninky hand. now, use the inky hand on the paper to makebrass hand harry's mark. talk to harry again, and he will affirm that the mark is satisfactory. go toport sarimand findredbeard franklocated south of the pub on the docks. he will not believe that jack has returned and will ask for proof - a letter from the terrorised monks to prove thatrabid jackreally is back. go back to mos le'harmless and findbrother tranquillityaround the dock area. talk to him and he will give you aletter. return to redbeard frank in port sarim and give him the letter.bill teachis on the ship on the way back, so you might as well starthis task(if you haven't already done it) now. frank says he will need better proof as tranquillity never actually saw jack and wants proof from one of his captains. get at least 3 pieces ofpirate clothingon and go topirate petenorth-east of theectofuntus; he will take you tobraindeath island. exit the brewery by going down the stairs on the south side to findcaptain donnienearby. talk to him wearing pirate clothing. you will say that you're a newzombie piratejust washed up from the sea and ask for plans. he will give someplans, but they're incomplete. captain donnie will tell that he accidentally carved the rest of the plans intoluke. luke, or rather, 50% luke, is located northwest of captain donnie, guarding the bridge. grab somecharcoalfrom the crates on the bridge. you'll have to go through the gate that's being guarded by luke, but your character will distract him long enough to get through. use the charcoal on 50% luke to obtain acharcoal rubbing. this will upset him, resulting in a rather humorous conversation regarding charcoal and a ""skin condition"". return to port sarim with the charcoal rubbing, and give it to redbeard frank to receivefrank's mark. travel tobrimhaven, and go to thebrimhaven agility arena, located south-east of the docks.cap'n izzy no-beardcan be found inside a small hut, the entrance to the arena. cap'n izzy will ask you to return to the rock island prison and get a brooch from his friend that died there,wanda the fish. go back torimmingtonand get arrested once more. you still have to store all your items in the locker before you go, but you don't need pirate clothing. izzy asked you to go back to the prison and search the mattress for some lockpicks to get into the other prison rooms. the storage room is where you need to go. search the bed and you will find acrude lockpick. use it on the jail door. kill acustoms officer. make sure you do not have lootshare enabled, as this can prevent the uniform from being dropped. since you can't take in any weapons, it may be hard to do any damage; you can however take a pickaxe from your tool belt and use that for increased accuracy. protect from/deflect melee andlegacy modecan also be used to make the fight much easier. you can also use potions before being arrested. take the officer's clothes (customs hat,customs shirtandcustoms trousers) and themithril scimitar. equip them, then go up two flights of stairs to arrive at the cabinet files room. click on the door and tell thelocker guardyou're there to get some evidence. go into the storage room and search the cabinets until you find thefileabout ""wanda the fish"" and take it. the files are in alphabetical order. talk to thelocker officer, and he will give you wanda's personal item, abrooch. if you drop the mithril scimitar inside the jail cell and act quick enough, you can pick the scimitar back up for the next section to make killing the customs officer a lot easier. do not equip the scimitar whilst inside the cell or the customs officer will take it away from you. either usehome teleportor dive into the water (the cell door remains unlocked) to leave with wanda's brooch. go back to captain izzy no-beard with wanda's brooch and give it to him to receiveizzy's mark. head back torimmingtonand talk to thecustoms sergeant. tell him that you want to make a confession, and he will give you an emptyfile. put the five marks of the captains in the file. talk to him again, and he will take the file with the five marks. after getting sent back to the prison, search the bed in the cell to get another lockpick, then open the door. after getting out, kill one of the customs officers and pick up their uniform andmithril scimitar. equip these, and head upstairs to the top. ask for 'your' file from thelocker officer. then, head back down to your cell (right click to open cell door) and talk to young ralph through the barred window. he will agree to tell of thebattle of the archipelago, where the united pirates of mos le'harmless defeated the fleet ofrabid jackand how he was a crew member of harry's ship. acutscenewill play. rabid jack's ship is on fire and hisbosun, giles, informs him thatcaptain donnieandthe inebriatedandmi-gorandthe hangmanhave fallen as well. a pirate,lizzie, attempts to apprehend jack, but is killed. young ralph fires a cannonball towardsthis albatross: hit! giles is killed and jack severely damaged and blown away by the impact. captains izzy, bill and braindeath will approach him and command that he give in. however, jack grabs his treasure chest and jumps off his ship, seemingly killing himself. the pirates are victorious! a disclaimer and some cute kittens follow. congratulations, quest complete! rocking out is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

achargebowis a common drop from skeletons and an uncommon drop from zombies, while thestaff of airis a common drop from skeletons and a very rare drop from zombies. pickaxes may also be brought in using the tool belt. it may also be possible to claim adeathtouched dartif one is available as a weekly progression reward from thechallenge system. once you are prepared, run north from ardougne toglarial's tombwhich is north-west of thefishing guild. you can teleport to the fishing guild if you have askills necklace. useglarial's pebblewith the tomb, and if you do not have any items in your inventory that are forbidden, the tomb will open. once inside the tomb, you will need to find and defeat a level 24moss giant. the moss giant is fairly weak, although will take time to defeat if unarmed, but if using a weapon of any kind it should prove no challenge at all. if you do fight it unarmed, severalabilitiessuch asanticipation,provoke,sacrificeanddebilitatecan still be used. using legacy mode and attacking with auto attacks is also a good strategy, as is usingdreadnipsand/orrings of recoil. once the moss giant is dead, take theconsecration seedit drops. additionally, if you do not have one already, takeglarial's amuletfrom the chest in the western cavern of the dungeon, as you will need it later. return to eluned in tirannwn, and she will re-enchant the consecration seed and tell you to plant it insideglarial's new resting placenear her remains so she can rest in peace. if you don't see eluned or islwyn, wait a few minutes and they should appear. you must now head to thewaterfall dungeon, which is where you had placedglarial's ashesback during thewaterfall quest. head to the house atopbaxtorian fallsand board the raft in the backyard, which will then crash on a small island. do not try to swim, but instead, use your rope on the nearby rock to reach the next island near the top of the waterfall. do not climb down, and instead use your rope on the dead tree to reach the entrance to the dungeon. make sure you are wearingglarial's amulet, and then enter the dungeon. if you do not haveyour key, search the crates in the north-east room to get another one. after you have the key, take the western path and run past the fire giants to reach a locked door. use the key on the door and the door after that to reach the final room of the dungeon. you may now plant the seed; to do so, simply left click it, and it will grow into a small crystal tree, consecrating the tomb. once you've planted the seed, head back to islywn, and he will thank you for what you've done, happy that both he and glarial can rest in peace. now that glarial is no longer restless, he will offer you a reward: a choice between thecrystal bowand thecrystal ward. choose either one, note that these are partially degraded and will only be charged to 20%, similar to when first purchasing a dungeoneering weapon. you can buy both later, regardless of which one you picked. congratulations, quest complete! roving elves is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

the prince offers a solution - trying to persuade the king of miscellania to marry the queen ofetceteria. now, speak with king vargas about his war threats against etceteria and he'll explain that he is just retaliating to queen sigrid's insults. he quickly changes the subject, telling you that various resources in his kingdom have been going missing, and asks you to investigate by talking to the citizens of miscellania and etceteria. exit the castle, and talk to any employed subject about the missing goods. talk to gardener gunnhild if all of the citizens are only saying ""good day, your royal highness"". they'll tell you that etceterian soldiers came and demanded tithes from them. your subjects refused, and they soon found some of their goods stolen. head east, cross the bridge over to etceteria, and enter their castle. climb the stairs to the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]and speak to queen sigrid. she tells you her side of the story, also saying that items have been stolen from her subjects, and is immediately suspicious of king vargas. go outside the castle and talk to one of the citizens there (except for the fishmonger or greengrocer, as they will just trade with you). they'll tell you the same story as their miscellania counterparts, but instead point the finger at miscellanian soldiers. inform both king vargas and queen sigrid of the current situation, and they'll tell you that neither of their lands has an army. king vargas also suggests speaking with advisor ghrim, to gather anything about recent suspicious activities. next, speak to advisor ghrim, who deduces that since miscellanians are very loyal, the thieves must have arrived onto the island from outside, and proposes talking to thesailorat the docks. visit the miscellania docks and converse with the sailor on the boat. after saying that advisor ghrim is struck with paranoia, he mentions ""those kids from rellekka"" who had come to visit their relatives in the dungeons. on further inquiry, the sailor tells you that since the war ended, more people have flocked over from the mainland and the dungeons had to be opened up for providing them shelter, and that's where the kids can be found. speak to king vargas again and ask how you can get into the dungeons to investigate the new arrivals. bemused on having forgotten about the dungeons, he writes on ascroll, granting you access into theunderground caves. before leaving, he also requests you to take a look into the odd sightings reported there. locate the dungeons in the south-west corner of miscellania's marketplace, and show the scroll to the guard there. after he approves, climb down the ladder to arrive in a small underground town. head to the bar on the eastern side of the underground town, and speak to the dwarf nameddonal. he tells you that he is working on the excavations but fears an enormous, terrible monster inside the cave tunnels to carry on with his work. tell him you will go fight the monster and he guides you how to get deeper into the tunnels. he gives you amining propfor stabilizing the cave entrance, and says you will have to fix the lift to climb the ledge. walk to the north-west edge of the underground area, use the mining prop on the crevice, and then squeeze through it. now, you need to repair the lift using items found in the boxes in the chamber: the lift should be operational now. before continuing, make sure you have a rope on you (grab another rope from the crate if needed) and then 'use-lift' on the platform to head closer to the mysteries of the island. after you step off the lift, grab theplankon the ground and enter the small tunnel to the east. follow the cavern east until you see a water pool. use your rope on the overhanging rock, and cross over the pool on the new ropeswing. head east a bit, and search thefire remainsto find aburnt diary, and a page in the embers; read the charred diary if you wish, and be sure to keep it. follow the bend further into the cavern until you reach another water body. use the plank on the slippery rocks to walk over them. as you travel through the cavern, search all the fire remains to find and add pages to the burnt diary. keep an eye out for piles of rock on the cavern walls: if you walk near them, the rocks will tumble down and cause 5% current life points of damage. to avoid the rocks, just walk closer to the middle of the caves. you would also have to cross a field of steam vents; they deal 5% current life points damage everygame tickyou are on them.surgecan be used to cross them safely. search the last fire remains for the fifth page of the diary, and read the finished notes. if you don't read the completed diary, you cannot proceed further; your chatbox dialogue will say ""maybe i should explore the cave more, before i go jumping through any more crevices."" follow the bend of the cavern until you come to a crevice in the north wall. squeeze through it to start a cutscene. you engage five lost, young rellekkans -armod,beigarth,hild,reinn, andsigny- in conversation. the teenagers explain that they were unable to pass their own trials to becomefremenniks, so they hatched a plan to start a war on the islands and then stop it to be seen as heroes and peacemakers by their clan. when the cutscene is over, continue talking to the kids. they tell you that they kept aside the stolen goods to return after their plan was complete, but a hugesea snaketook residence with them, and request you to take care of it in exchange for leaving the island. leave the fremennik teenagers, and continue into the cavern, passing lots of non-aggressive, venomoussea snake hatchlingsandsea snake young, until you come to a shaft of light from the surface and a crevice in the north wall; squeeze past it. you enter a chamber filled with hatched and unhatched snake eggs, and agiant sea snake(level 63) emerges out of the water. with adefencelevel of around 50 and level-appropriate equipment, the fight should not be a challenge. the sea snake fights withmeleeup close andrangedfrom a distance, and the appropriate protection prayers are recommended. the snake will poison you if you are hit successfully, so take a sip from anantipoison potioneither before entering her chamber or as soon as she poisons you. after she is killed, pick up theheavy boxcontaining the stolen items, albeit only from etceteria. exit the cave and, through the hole above the chamber, a guard sees you and tosses a rope down for you to climb up. do so, and you'll find yourself just outside the town walls of etceteria. make your way to queen sigrid, and inform her of what you learned about the teenagers and the sea snake. she gives you anapology letterto take to king vargas, thus preventing a possibly devastating war. head back to king vargas, telling him too about the situation in the dungeons, and give him the queen's letter to complete the quest. royal trouble is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

of them are trashed patches and are unusable. the south-eastern patch is still arable and is indicated on yourminimapwith the farming icon. rake away the weeds in theblindweed patch, and plant yourblindweed seed. wait for theblindweedto grow (takes 1 minutes and 50 seconds). you get the message, ""i wonder how my blindweed is coming along?"" when it is fully grown. there is a chance of it growing quite quickly. try intimidating the zombies while you wait. pick the herb. while around the farming patches, you may be attacked byzombie swabs. find a convenient safe spot, such as the other side of a broken fence, and choose the intimidate zombie swab option to stop them from attacking you. you have to scare each swab only once. the game censors your intimidating insult, and you see instead a short cutscene of a kitten playing with a ball of wool. return to captain braindeath, and speak with him. he tells you to put the blindweed in the intake hopper upstairs. head to the south-east corner of the building and climb up the ladder. head to the north-west corner of the floor, next to the pressure barrel and pressure lever. use the blindweed on the hopper, then return to captain braindeath to find the next ingredient. talk to captain braindeath again. he says he needsstagnant water() from a nearby volcano. if you don't have a bucket in your inventory, the captain gives you one. you can also pick up the bucket that spawns near him. leave the building via the south wooden stair again, pass through the fence, and travel north-west to find50% lukeguarding a small gate. open the gate and walk through: you automatically make a diversion for the guard. head north, crossing the two bridges. when you reach the island, go north-east for a short bit, and then follow the path up the volcano. use a bucket on the stagnant lake to collect a bucket of water. head back down the mountain and to the gate. open the gate, and 50% luke is upset you are outside the compound and allows you to walk through. return to the captain, who tells you to pour the bucket in the hopper. climb up the ladder, and use the bucket of water you collected on the hopper. climb back down the ladder, and return to captain braindeath. talk to the captain again. he says you need to catch five loads ofsluglingsand gives you afishbowl and net, which is afishbowltangled in abig net(if you untangle the fishbowl and net, use one on the other to retangle them). head south to the farming patch you used earlier: several fishing spots are close by. another spot is west of the farming patches and south of 50% luke. fish the fishing spot with the fishbowl and net to catch five fish. you may catch fish other than the sluglings, but it doesn't matter which fish you get. after getting the fish, it is not necessary to talk to braindeath since he has already told you to ""pressurise them"". return to the attic, but instead of putting the sluglings in the hopper, you will have to ""pressurise"" them. put them in the pressure barrel up the ladder next to the hopper and pull the pressure lever. you see the brewing control start to shake violently. head back down to captain braindeath. talk to the captain. he tells you a spirit has possessed the brewing controls and gives you awrench. he says to get the wrench blessed and then give the controls a couple of belts with it. go to the pirate bunkhouse just west of the main room to finddavey. talk with davey, and ask him to bless your wrench. after an amusing discussion with him, he blesses your wrench, turning it into aholy wrench. he will only bless the wrench if you have at least 423 prayer points. the blessing may drain some of your points. now, get ready for a fight. if you forgot to bring your combat gear, you can return toport phasmatysand bank by speaking withpirate peteat the dock north-east ofcaptain braindeath. use the holy wrench on the spinning, possessed brewing control just south of the captain, and a level 56evil spiritappears. kill it, using yourprotect from meleeprayer to reduce damage if you need to. the spirit has no weakness, so all styles are equally effective. if ranging or maging, you can trap the evil spirit behind a support beam and the brewing control and not take any damage, but this shouldn't be necessary. return and speak again with the captain. he tells you to get the last ingredient: the body of a deceasedfever spider. climb down the ladder south-west of the captain's room, equip yourslayer glovesand kill a fever spider. fever spiders are level 70 and weak to crush attacks. they hit rather high, so make sure you have a good amount of food. collect itscarcass, use it on the hopper upstairs, and return tocaptain braindeath. talk to the captain again. he tells you to ""watch the glory of brewin' at its best!"" you see a short cutscene, and ask ""is that it?"". he says yes and tells you to ""feed the stuff to the pirates"". he gives you another bucket to hold the rum. turn the output tap on the south side of the brewing vat to get a bucket ofunsanitary swill. head outside, down the wooden stair to the farming patches. findcaptain donnie, talk to him, and give him the 'rum'. after some dialogue, donnie tells you thatrabid jackis the name of his boss. return tocaptain braindeath, speak with him again for one last time, and claim your reward.

convincewizard valinato allow her access into the tower because ariane believes there is a serious threat to it. however, valina refuses becausearchmage sedridorforbids her entry for any reason. it is then that she asks the player to pass the message to sedridor. suddenly, a cutscene ensues showing a magical vortex attackingwizard borannthe librarian. you and ariane attempt to enter the tower but ariane is warded off by a spell and falls to the ground. she tells you to lure the vortex to the centre of the power beam by castingair strikeon it. you can pick up thetower mindspike (air)west side next to borann if you don't have anyair runes. stand at the other side of the beam, set a spell to auto-cast and attack the vortex to lure it into place. the spell can fail, especially if you have low magic accuracy from wearing non-magic armour. while instructed to use air strike, you can use any air elemental spell (from either the standard or ancient spellbook). any magicabilitiesalso work. keep doing this until the vortex moves to the centre of the beam, then it will disappear. talk to ariane outside the tower by the bridge. when asked why she was not allowed to enter the tower, she reveals herself to be a seer. she tells that at the tower students are taught that anyone can learn magic even without talent, but that being a seer is passed on through the family. as such, the other students resented ariane for it. she had asked her mentor,wizard ellaron, to help her suppress her powers, but instead he helped her develop them. at some point, she had an encounter with thetower's demon, who made the conversation look as if she were azamorakian, and used magic not from thestandard spellbook, which ultimately lead to her expulsion byarchmage sedridor. hence, he regards her dangerous enough to put up a ward spell against her. ariane also tells about the old wizards' tower. one hundred years ago, the wizards' tower was divided in four orders: the red, blue, green and grey wizards. when they found out the secret of the rune mysteries, the teleportation spell to therune essence mines(senventior disthine molenko), the red wizards turned against the others, which somehow led to the tower being burnt down.archmage perienhad the tower rebuilt, sealed the old tower's ruins and banished all zamorakian red wizards. ariane has seen the tower in flames in one of her premonitions, which generally show the truth. being stuck outside the tower, she asks you to talk to archmage sedridor, wizard ellaron and the other wizards to try and find out if anything unusual is happening lately. enter back into the tower and ask wizards if they've seen anything unusual. return to ariane and tell her about traiborn's observations of the creatures coming from the library floor. she will tell you more about the history of the tower and how it was destroyed many years ago by zamorakian wizards. the new tower was built upon the ruins of the old tower, whose underground levels were sealed off by the first archmage of the new tower,archmage perien. ariane will tell you of an old rumour that the door to the ruins can be unlocked by castingwater surge, but many wizards have tried that to no avail. go back into the tower after speaking with ariane and talk towizard ellaronin the north-eastern room after ascending the beam twice. talk to him about accessing the ruins. he states that not even senior wizards have permission to access the ruins, therefore making it impossible for him to tell ""an ex-wizard"" and ""an outsider"" how to do so. ask him if he knows how to enter the ruins and he will tell that only the archmage is allowed to know the secret. talk to him about the water surge rumour, and he will hint that understanding the spell might be the key. ask him about the ruins and he will tell you of how it was sealed byarchmage perien, and his great understanding of magic. he will tell you that he wrote a book on the relation between magic and music. ask if this is a hint and he will deny it, but will tell you that the book is available in theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us]. descend the beam twice to return back to theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us]where you will be able to find the book. the book is located in the most eastern floating bookshelf. you will findthe harmony of the runesandthe runes of the spells of water. both books can be right-clicked to view an attached diagram in each. read both the books first, which will allow the notes to be placed automatically on the organ. go to the southern part of theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us]of the tower and play the organ. you will have to play the notes in a specific sequence, as shown by the diagrams on the screen. you will need to click on some black keys and some white keys to play it, you can hover over keys to see what they are. it does not matter which octave you play them in. play the following notes the number of times shown to get the key: if you play it correctly, awizards' tower basement keywill appear on the interface. click it to add it to your inventory. tell ariane you have the key and she'll be inquisitive of the content of the old tower, wishing that she could find knowledge that might have been lost for hundreds of years. she will tell you that the entrance to the ruins is to the east of the tower, down a small flight of steps. go east and you will find ariane near some ruins. talk to her and she'll tell you to open the door. walk down the nearby stairs and use the wizards' tower basement key on the door to open it.  if you click outside of the chatbox before the door opens and you enter, the door will not open and the key will disappear.  in this case, you must go back and play the organ again as above to retrieve the key. a cutscene of you and ariane entering the basement will play. she will tell you that this must be the chamber of shrines, which was used as a meeting room and the place where apprentices would pledge allegiance to one of the four orders. you can ask her for more information about orders which were created to cater the different philosophies of magic. you will need to go deeper in the ruins but there is a rune guardian blocking the road. talk to therune guardianand it will begin talking about a test. ariane will explain that the guardian thinks you are new wizards joining the tower. the test consists of 5 questions. your answers determine the order you belong to, therefore thetitleyou get. you can retake the test as many times as you would like to get the title you want. the titles are:[name]the blue,[name]the green,[name]the greyand[name]the red. the title you receive does not matter for the quest. question 1:""you are behind in your studies due to illness, and a test is coming up. your place at the tower is safe, but if you fail you will lose some respect. another apprentice offers you an opportunity to cheat."" question 2:""an elderly wizard - the last practitioner of a unique branch of magic - dies. her diary might contain details about her unique magic, but her will states that the diary should be destroyed on her death."" question 3:""a rival wizard is spreading lies about you and has made you the laughing stock of a nearby village. they believe you are of low intelligence and poor moral character, and throw vegetables at you when you visit. what do you do?"" question 4:""you have become a senior wizard and are asked to take on an apprentice. the boy is talented but undisciplined and does not apply himself out his areas of interest. what is your approach?"" question 5:""a senior wizard asks you to take part in a ritual that will greatly benefit the tower. before the ritual starts, you discover that he learned part of it from a demon. the ritual appears safe, but demons are expert liars."" after the guardian determines the order you belong to it will allow you to proceed. enter the door that was behind it. if you land in between two orders you will be asked one more question: question 6:""you are balanced between two orders. a final question: which of these do you value most?"" talk to ariane in the new room. you will see a gap in the stairs and ariane wants you to find a way to cross it. climb behind thestatuein the wall south of the gap and make a bridge by pushing the statue down. cross the newly made bridge then climb down the staircase at the west of the room. talk to ariane about the new room to find out more historical information about spells. she will tell you that the vortices you see are like the ones that attacked wizard borann so she wants to find out what they are. you are going to need to lure one of the vortices (doesn't matter which one) to the circle ariane creates and keep it in the circle until she has finished examining it (around one minute). you can lure a vortex towards you by casting a magic spell on it (you may need to take off non-magic armour to lure). the vortices will keep moving around, so it's expected that it will get out of the circle more than once. the timer slowly resets when the vortex get out of the circle. luring multiple vortices at once will make the timer less likely to reset. the vortices aren't ghosts as ariane first thought they might be. they are soul fragments. she will explain that the old wizards put part of their souls into the power beam to create a very powerful magical effect. however, this looks like it went wrong. ariane thinks this might be what destroyed the first tower. she tells you that an enchantment might have sealed the vortices and someone removed it which allowed the vortices to go up the beam into the tower. someone came to the ruins very recently and removed this enchantment. ariane can replace the enchantment, but this will take some time. she will ask you to go to the new tower and delay sedridor's plan. (you must answer 'okay i'll do it' for ariane to not follow you back up.) retrace your way out of the ruins and enter the tower. you will see sedridor and three wizards casting icyenic purge. try talking to sedridor and he will simply ignore you. play the organ twice, pressing random keys on the middle or lowest keys on keyboard to break the wizards' concentration. you will annoy sedridor and see a cutscene of ariane preparing the enchantment. play the organ once more, and see another of her casting the spell. after the cutscene, head back to ariane who is standing outside the entrance of the ruins and talk to her to complete the quest. rune mysteries is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: ariane casts a spell. ariane sends her spell up the beam. the icyenic purge is completed, and ariane's spell arrives."

(this will hit for 500 life points) if the character dies, just reenter the dungeon and talk to kennith to teleport. after completing the puzzle kennith will ask if you are ready to be teleported to thefishing platform. say i'm ready and teleport to the fishing platform. thefishing platformis located due east of witchaven. to reach the fishing platform, if you didn't take the offer of being teleported when asked in the quest, talk tojebwho can be found in the northern part of witchaven. he will row you out to the fishing platform. once you reach the platform talk with kennith and he will tell you that you need some ingredients for ananti-mind control serum. he says you will need some blood, given freely. to get the blood you simply punchbaileyand then respond, ""so you don't feel pain?"". then say, ""no pain? prove it."" bailey will then take a shard of glass and cut his arm to prove that he no longer feels pain. he will give you theblood-stained glassas proof of this. kennith also tells you that you need a live specimen for the potion. to get a sea slug, head east to the fishing spot. lure the fishing spot (don't try to take the slug, as this will damage you for 30 life points) and go back to kennith, the slug will follow you. kennith will daze and telegrab the slug for you. adazed sea slugwill appear in your inventory. you will need a free inventory slot for the slug. talk to him and he will say that you have all of the ingredients and give you theseeker gland. pick up the pestle and mortar in the room (a pestle and mortar from the tool belt will work as well) and use any piece of the potion to make theanti-mind control serum. talk to kennith to prompt your team to move to the cave entrance.  go west to the cave. enter the cave by talking to theslug thrallsand ask,""why can't we come in?"". then""i'm not a stranger"",""i seek enlightenment in the joining"", and finally,""i wish to hear the..."". the guards will let you enter the slug citadel. theslug citadelconsists of a series of rooms. you will need to make your way, with your party of adventurers, through the rooms by solving puzzles. the rooms have a varying number ofrisen knights, some of which will need to be killed and some of which can be avoided. the members of your party will be healed to full health automatically when you move on to the next room. unfortunately, your character is not healed so you will need to bring some food. the exception to this is if one of your party dies before the room is completed, in that case, all members will be healed (including yourself) and you will only need to restart that room. if you log off you will find yourself outside on witchaven near jeb but all completed rooms will remain completed, and killedrisen knightswill stay dead except the ones the village people conjure. you will have to walk yourself and your characters through all completed rooms to return to the last room you were in before you logged out. your characters will follow you automatically wherever you go and if they are attacked they will fight to the end unless you move them or regroup. to make a character stay in or go to a specific point simply click on the character and click where you want them to go. the same principle applies to using them to knock out witchaven guardians/killing risen knights or pulling levers. always make sure that you click the character again to return control to your player or you will find your character running aimlessly around the screen. alternatively, you can click control straight from one character to another, but practise this first as this action will be needed when in the 4th citadel room which is the most difficult. it doesn't matter which characters you use, but they are named in the guide to allow you to keep track of them. you may sometimes have trouble getting the characters to pull the levers; you may order them to do so only for them to simply stand there. positioning the characters directly in front of the lever before clicking on it will solve this problem. this room has a number of gates blocking your way to the exit. there are levers which can be pulled to open the gates. the levers need to be opened in a particular order so you can progress. if you are spotted by witchaven villager, you will be frozen for a few seconds and a risen knight is summoned and attacks you. this room is similar to the first room in that a number of levers have to be pulled in a certain order to open gates for your character to progress to the exit.  killing all the risen knights will make the room easier. the easiest way is to simply do this yourself, as you are likely much more powerful than your companions. you can rest while the others are defeating the risen knights if you need to raise your hit points. in this room your character releases various waves ofrisen knightswhile trying to open the exit. the risen knights have to be killed in order to proceed. unfortunately, your character is stuck and cannot fight. you have to use the other members of your adventurer's party to kill the knights. use your character to investigate the strange device; your character will become unplayable andrisen knightswill begin to appear one at a time. the knights are not usually aggressive so take time to plan. once the first wave of three knights are dead your character will investigate the second hole. two knights will appear at a time for a total of six knights in the second wave. once the second wave is dead a third wave will appear and two to three knights will appear at a time for a total of 9 knights in the third wave. continue on into the last room. if a party member dies, you will have to restart the room. make sure you take advantage of thecombat triangleor this battle will be difficult. the hero that you send into battle first will take the most damage, so keep the lower health ones as backup. it is best to use the 'select all' command to attack therisen knightsand then pulling back eva to behind the pillar as the knights will continue to take damage from kennith and ezekiel. when more than one risen knight appears, target mage first, then melee and finally the range knight. alternatively send the player who corresponds to the opposite in the combat triangle to attack first, then use a secondary player (kennith is most useful) to double up on the attack. ezekial can be useful here even with the number of melee knights here. he can be used to tank hits due to his high life points. he may also be used to lure the knights behind the pillar so that they cannot damage your party. you cannot heal your characters in this room and once they die, you have to restart the room. once the fight is over, there is no need to heal your party for they will be back to full health upon entering the last room. it is possible for the players to become stuck in this room. after a couple of waves of risen knights, the game may fail to spawn more, rendering the player unable to continue. this is caused by killing the last two knights (that spawn next to one another) at the same time. to prevent this from happening, be sure to kill these last two knights one at a time. currently, it seems the only way to bypass this (if it does occur) is to log out and restart the dungeon. the player only has to run through the already completed floors.  this is the last room and is the climax of the quest. once the cutscene is complete, mother mallum takes control of the player. mother mallum throws eva into the pillar. the pillar is toppled over, killing mother mallum, and freeing the player. you can talk freely with any of the three characters/adventurers before leaving the cave of the slug citadel. questions that once had a response of ""we have a mission to do,"" will be answered by the characters. note that not all of the information given by the characters pertains to the quest itself. they will talk about themselves or their relations with the other adventurers in the party. talk tolucy, the choice will not have any effect on the outcome, though lying is arguably the nicer choice. leave the citadel using the cave exit (the same one you entered with). congratulations, quest complete! salt in the wound is not currently required for any quests or miniquests. when the quest was released, it had a large amount of massive flaws and plot holes, such ascaptain marlin's omission from the quest, the seemingly random dead stalker, most npcs acting out of character or the plot set up inthe slug menacesimply being ignored. starting with the previous quest line being completely ignored, to the forced inclusion of dungeoneering, large amounts of humour in a quest line that was previously very dark, and then ending on an anticlimax involving a conveniently placed pillar falling on the boss. this quest was perceived to be a massive disappointment as it was generally agreed that it did not live up anywhere close to the potential the previous quest had set up. it remains poorly regarded long after its release: in 2022, when discussing potentialrunescapequests from the 2008-2011 era to be ported toold school runescape, developer mod ed criticised salt in the wound and cited it as an example of a quest that would never be ported toold schoolunder any circumstances.[3]"

(ironmanaccounts will not receive these)","shades of mort'tonis a quest dealing with the strange affliction to the townspeople of a small village namedmort'ton. the player uncovers an old cure for the affliction and must help the village. it is difficult to complete this quest alone, players may try to visit world 88 and do it together with other players. strangers return from such visits with tales of the 'afflicted' and shadowy creatures who jealously guard their tomb treasure. much like theelemental workshopseries, this quest is not started by an npc, but rather, the player's own curiosity, and is contingent upon further exploration. this quest can be done in any world, but as getting the temple to 100% repair is difficult on their own, players should consider usingworld 88, the officialshades of mort'tonworld. this will allow you to repair the temple quicker and easier with more players, as it is more difficult to do the temple repair by yourself. players will need to gather all items needed for the quest before going tomort'ton, because there is no convenient opportunity to bank during the quest. unless players have completed the questin aid of the myrequeand finished restoring theburgh de rottbank, the bank south of mort'ton will not be functional and should not be relied on. thus, abeast of burdenfamiliar can help by carrying items. without access to theancient magicksor another advanced methods of quick transport to the area, players will need to arrive fully prepared. if players use their last dose ofserum 207before completing the quest, they will need to obtain more tarromin. more tarromin can be obtained by killingafflictedforgrimy tarromin, but this is a rather uncommon drop, so bringing extra tarromin is recommended. to start shades of mort'ton, enter the southernmost building in mort'ton, which is a ruined house with lots of broken glass and vials. search the shelf on the wall to find thediary of herbi flax, which begins the quest when read. right click and search thesmashed tableto obtain twotarrominherbs and onerogue's purseherb. both tarromin herbs will be used later, so keep them. pick up the emptyvials, which spawn inside the house where you found the book. fill the vials with water at a sink in a house on the eastern side of mort'ton. read the book, which explains how to makeserum 207, a potion that cures the afflicted for a short amount of time. the ingredients are avial of water,clean tarrominandashes. if the player has no ashes, they can chop down one of the local trees and burn the logs, then pick up the resulting ashes. the potion will be used to cure the affliction of the townspeople, so that the player can talk with them. make two potions and use a dose onrazmirein thegeneral store. ask razmire about the shadowy creatures and he will tell you they areloar shadesand that his stock of building supplies have been put away because the town is overrun with them. he instructs you to kill 5 of them. the shades are green in colour and are level 58. in order to complete razmire's request, you need to kill the shades and pick up the 5 remains. any shades killed before talking to razmire will not count. after killing 5 shades, bring the 5 remains to razmire. razmire will probably be afflicted, so another dose of serum 207 is necessary. razmire will take two remains off you to experiment with, and will now let you usehis shop. go into the house south east of the general store. use the serum onulsquire shauncy, who is said to be a priest who may know how to lay the shades to rest. talk to him, and he will take one set of loar remains. wait a moment after giving him the remains, then go through all the chat options available. he explains that the remains should be laid to rest in the temple of mort'ton, referred to asflamtaer. this is done through a holy cremation, usingpyre logs(logs treated withsacred oil). however, sacred oil can only be obtained by rebuilding the temple. after talking to ulsquire, head back to razmire. ask razmire to open the general store and the builder's store. buy at least one vial ofolive oil, 10timber beams, 10limestone bricks, and 50swamp paste. beams and bricks must be paired, and for every pair the player will need 5 paste. keep in mind that the temple is built by players, so more or less resources may be needed, depending on the condition of the temple. optionally, buy aflamtaer hammerfor 13,000 coins, and you will construct the temple faster. the temple is on the north-east coast of mort'ton, on a little island across a small bridge. use the beams, bricks, and paste to repair the temple of mort'ton.craftingexperience is gained from repairing the temple. flamtaer braceletscan help in the construction of the temple walls. the bracelet comes with 2 charges, and when the effect activates, it can instantly build the wall. it is suggested to have multiple bracelets, especially if soloing the activity.shade luring dummiescan be used to distract theloar shadeswhen repairing the temple. the temple is maintained fairly often on world 88, the official shades of mort'ton world, but at times it will be deserted even on that world. using shade luring dummies, flamtaer bracelets, and a flamtaer hammer makes it possible, although somewhat difficult, to repair the temple without the help of other players, although asking friends for help may be preferable. once the temple has reached 100% repair status, the sacred altar in the centre will become functional with a puff of smoke. light the torch that appears on the altar with atinderbox. you will need at least 20% sanctity, which you can get by killing the loar shades that attack the temple or by rebuilding and/or re-enforcing the temple. while killing shades, players only get sanctity for actual kills, and sanctity level is constantly drained. aoe attacks can speed this process up, to combat the constant drain. once the fire altar is lit (which can only happen once the temple is fully repaired), use theolive oilon the flame to makesacred oil. although optional, is it helpful to also use theserum 207on this flame to make it intoserum 208, which will permanently cure an afflicted, especially useful on razmire. blessing anything on the altar uses an amount of the player's sanctity percentage. blessing olive oil uses about 10% per vial, whereas blessing serum 207 uses 20% sanctity. serum 208will permanently cure bothrazmire keelganandulsquire shauncy. however, using it on one of the'afflicted' npcswill register as a kill, and the npc will eventually respawn, re-afflicted. when afflicted npcs are given a dose of either serum, they give the player random items. a full list can be foundhereorhere for serum 208. now you need to create pyre logs, which are obtained by using sacred oil on any type of logs. the easiest type of logs to obtain is normal logs, by chopping nearby trees. use the sacred oil on logs to create apyre log. basic wood will use only two doses of sacred oil, but higher types of wood (such asmaple logs) will use more doses at a time. take the pyre log and a set of loar remains to a funeral pyre, which are the sets of four stone beds around the edge of the town. there are some located south-east of ulsquire's house. use the pyre logs on the funeral pyre, then use the loar remains on it. quickly light this to cremate the shade (if you wait too long, the remains and logs will disappear). you will see the spirit of the shade rise from the pyre, and receive an amount of bothprayerandfiremakingexperience. as the spirit departs, a gift of thanks will appear in your inventory. the rewards will be either a stack of coins, or ashade key. head back toulsquire. use your serum on him, if you have not permanently cured him with

simply pick some and use one on the sword. if you do not have the dyed sword, evil dave won't let you enter the demon's lair. you do not need to wield the dyed silverlight in order to enter; you can wield another weapon, as long as you have the dyed silverlight in your inventory. talk to evil dave again, and ask to join the cult. a cutscene will start, showing evil dave leading you to the leader of the group,denath. denath will accept you into his group because another member,josef, has disappeared. denath will tell you that he needs your help to summon agrith naar. he will also tell you the incantation to use, which is different for everyone, so you will need to remember it. one possibility is to type the incantation into the chat box. talk tojennifer, one of the dark wizards, to get ademonic sigil mould. go to al kharid and use the demonic sigil mould on the furnace, while having the silver bar in your inventory or metal bank, to make ademonic sigil. if you haven't done so, stock up on potions and food for your final battle with level 84 agrith naar. you no longer need your black outfit to enter the portal. the demon uses magic and melee attacks, so one good strategy is to load up on melee-protection armour. for example,dragon armourandprotect from magic/deflect magictogether. if you were already wearingblack dragonhide armourfor your three pieces of black clothing, you can also range the demon; the dragonhide will protect you from taking too much damage from the demon's magic spells.prayer potionsmay be necessary. return to uzer, enter the demon's lair again, and talk tomatthew. he will tell you aboutjosefand a book he had found. go back outside, and talk to theclay golem. they will tell you that denath killed josef, but not before josef hid a large book in one of the broken kilns. make sure to talk to the clay golem, otherwise you won't get the ""look"" option while trying to search the kilns. look in the kilns around uzer (do not forget to check the one north of the magic carpet, and the one to the east of the temple) to find ademonic tome. you will also now find father reen standing outside the temple's ruins. if you want, you can have an interesting discussion with him about his religion. read the book, then return through the portal and discuss the content with matthew. matthew notes the incantation for summoning the demon that's written in the book is backward to the one that denath told you to say. denath will now call you over to take your place and lead the incantation; using your sigil, chant it in the order that denath told you (you can ask denath for the incantation in case you forgot). after finishing the incantation, denath walks to the centre of the magic circle, and disappears. you realise that denath was agrith naar all along, and you actually desummoned him by saying the incantation backward. this particular demon is much more powerful in his own dimension, so you need to resummon agrith naar to defeat it. pick up the sigil that denath dropped, as you will need multiple sigils. you will have to make another one if you forget to pick it up. evil dave,eric, andtanyawill run away. chase after them through the portal. when you exit the portal, you will occasionally take small amounts of damage from falling rocks in the basement and in the sandstorm outside in uzer. tanya will be killed by the ghosts in the basement, so pick up her sigil. talk to evil dave, who will tell you that eric was killed by a collapsed ceiling and will give you eric's sigil; tell evil dave to return to the lair. go up the stairs and talk to father badden and father reen, and give them each a sigil. talk to the clay golem and try to convince them to help you - the clay golem says that they were programmed to never enter the demon’s portal. go back into the basement, take thestrange implementfrom the north-west corner, and use it on the golem to take out the scroll. talk to the golem again, and they will agree to help you now, taking the final sigil. if you forget to pick up a demonic sigil, you can make another one with a silver bar and the demonic sigil mould. go back into the demon's lair, and talk to matthew to get everyone to stand in the circle. take your place in the circle, and use your sigil to chant the incantation in the order you read in josef's book (it is the same as the previous incantation, just backwards). agrith naar will appear in the circle, enraged for being summoned. he will kill matthew, and then move to attack you. by default, he uses melee up close and castsfire blastat a distance. if you useprotection prayers, he will automatically use the alternate attack style. agrith naar can hit into the 200s and 300s with both styles. however, the demon is extremely easy for his level - a player with level 70 combat, and good armour, should be able to finish him easily, with little need for food. agrith naar does not have any weakness, so any attack style will work against him, although the final blow must be made by the silverlight, regardless of what weapon you have equipped. as such, melee is recommended over ranged or magic. if the final blow is dealt with any other weapon, agrith naar will regenerate some of his life points. adwarf multicannoncannot be used to attack agrith naar. when the demon is dead, the quest will complete and a message will appear telling you that the demon's blood has merged with your silverlight, turning it intodarklight. agrith naar's blood stains silverlight, turning it into darklight. shadow of the storm is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

cargo still aboard. the island is apparently deserted and an evil aura hangs over it. he asks you to travel to ashdale to investigate. speak to gudrik again and select the option to travel to ashdale by night. when you arrive in ashdale, walk through the town. you will encounter some slime and a claw on the way, inspect them if you wish, and then continue until you meetlucy, who is cowering in her house. she tells you that the town was attacked by horrible creatures, and although she avoided them by hiding in her attic, the townspeople were taken away. she doesn't know where they are now, but guesses they may be under the island somewhere. you say that you need to get to the other side of the island and she suggests using the sewers, which can be entered through a pipe behind her house. enter the sewer from the storm drain out the back door. the sewer is populated by a few non-aggressive level 2sewer rats, and three coin spawns can be found along the way; pick these up if you wish (60, 50, and 40 coins, respectively). when you reach a large chamber, you will step in some slime and acrassian scoutwill ambush you from above. it attacks with ranged and melee, and has the ability to stun you and then retreat to attack you from a distance. when its adrenaline bar reaches over 50%, it gains the ability to use an attack which will damage you heavily, depleting its adrenaline in the process. alternatively, you can run past the scout. on death, the crassian will drop aminnow. although picking it up is not necessary for the quest, it can be eaten to heal 150 life points. continue down the sewer and you will eventually reach the second chamber, with a second crassian scout. either run past it or kill it and head up the ladder. you will emerge from a storm drain in the ashdale farm, now devoid of cows. head south up two sets of stairs (past the minnow pond), and after a short cutscene showing a house, you'll reach two more crassian scouts. again, either dodge them or kill them. go through the gate to the south and enter the house at the top. search the table to find apage from an old journal, which explains that the house was built by thefourth agearchitect ogden plainview, on top of a seastack that houses a vertical tunnel which leads to a large network of caverns. the page also reveals that he was thinking of making a hidden entrance to the caves in the house. inspect the bust of his head, and the centrepiece of the room will transform into a staircase leading to the caves. descend the stairs. you will now be in the largeashdale caveswith anothercrassian scoutand a dead smuggler. search the body to find asmuggler's journal, which explains that a band of smugglers had discovered the caves and planned to make it their hideout. they accidentally stirred up a nest of creatures, which abducted their captain and killed the rest of the crew. advance down the cave, which contains another scout. enter a cavern containingbarrels, pipes, and a large door which you must open by channelling water to it. collect thevalve outer wheel,valve inner wheelandpitch. repair the leak in the pipe using the pitch, combine the wheel parts into avalve wheelby using them on each other and then repair the socket on the central barrel. the barrel at the end of the pipe is already full of water, and you will need to turn the valve wheel on that barrel to move it to the other barrels in sequence, until you flush down the last barrel into the door, which opens it. go through the door and enter a chamber where you will find three more crassian scouts. this chamber contains crassian pods, which appear to play some part in the crassian reproductive process. kill the scouts and the barrier to the next area will disintegrate. unless you have low life points, do not leave this room without killing all three scouts, otherwise your progress will be reset and you will have to kill another three scouts. optionally search the chest in the northwest to find 125 coins and anuncut sapphire. enter the next tunnel and approach the next area, where a cutscene will show the approach of acrassian warriorpatrolling over a corridor with a spike trap beneath it. if you approach the creature, it will fire an unavoidable and unblockable ranged attack that deals damage equal to your current life points. however, being hit and killed by the attack does not count as dying - it simply places you at the start of the area with all of your items intact. to get past the warrior, go over and pull the lever on the opposite wall whilst its back is turned. this will activate the spike trap, killing the warrior and opening the barrier to the next area. the next area has another crassian warrior moving around a circular trap. dispatch it in the same way by pulling the lever on the opposite wall while avoiding contact with the creature, which will open the barrier to the next room. in the third crassian warrior area, there are two separate warriors on two different traps. avoid the first warrior and find the lever on the northern wall at the second warrior and pull it to dispatch both of them. through the next barrier, after the body of another dead smuggler, optionally search a chest to find 500 coins and three more uncut sapphires. in the next area, there are two traps, each with two warriors patrolling. the lever can be found on the northern wall at the second trap. continue onward towards a large ship and you will encounter two scouts after a short cutscene, which you can either run past or kill. optionally search the chest to find 132 coins and anuncut emerald. climb on to the ship. fourtentacleswill appear from underneath and attack you. kill each of the four in turn. they have 201 life points and have a damage received cap of 40 life points per hit. though they are easy to kill, some food might be useful. they attack by slamming the area in front of them, and they shake before doing so, giving you ample time to move away to avoid it. after they are defeated, a giant crassian known asagorothwill then emerge from the ship, being revealed to be the true source of the tentacles. you will now need to defeat him in order to save the residents of ashdale. standing close to agoroth during the fight will result in being hit by a constant 100% hitting attack which deals a constant amount of damage. standing further away will result in tentacles riding from your side of the ship, similar to the previously encountered ones but not attackable. from the moment you are at their range they will start whirling and then will hit the ground dealing a constant amount of damage if you did not get out of their range, which is wider than how it actually looks. while above 50% health, agoroth will frequently use a special attack, a flow of water that will knock you back if hit and damage you. this attack covers half of the ship's width and its range is bigger than agoroth's normal attack. on agoroth's health bar, there are marks at 3/4, 1/2 and 1/4. once he is beneath 50% of his life points, agoroth will start using another heavily damaging special attack in the form of green material falling in patterns on the floor. he will become shielded and invulnerable, and dark marks will appear on two opposite quarters of the floor. run to an area where there aren't any marks, or you will be dealt heavy damage. when under 25% life points, his special attack will cover 5/9 of the floor, spread diagonally. if you find defeating agoroth hard, you can use some kind of hit and run technique. if you run up either of the ship's staircases towards the stern of the ship, you will be protected from any kind of attack, and you could use a long-range weapon (range or magic) to attack. in order to attack you must get closer, but you can easily attack once or even twice and run back to the safe spot before being hit by the tentacles. using this method will take some time but will help you win if you cannot manage to win easily. after agoroth is dead, the townspeople will be freed and cheer for you. you will then be taken back to a much sunnierashdale, and you may optionally talk to some of the extremely grateful villagers for them to thank you. when you are ready to leave, speak to lucy, and you will return togudrikinport sarim. you will tell him of what has occurred, and he will congratulate you. ask for your reward to complete the quest. a shadow over ashdale is not currently required for any quests or miniquests."

he quickly departs, before handing you abone shard. the shard upon inspecting reads,""i am the key, but only kin may approach her."" take the bone shard back to trufitus and he'll tell you to look for bervirius's tomb, as he shared his bloodline with rashiliyia, and find a clue regarding the queen's whereabouts. many players do not get the option to climb down the ""well stacked rocks"" in the next part of the quest. this is because trufitus has not told them to look for the tomb. read both scrolls, inspect the bones, then show the items to trufitus, and don't leave until he's suggested that there might be something useful in the tomb. ask: ""i need help with bervirius"". you now need to go to thetomb of bervirius. from tai bwo wannai, head south-west tocairn isle. climb up the rocks (you can fail and take 10% of your current life points as damage) and cross the bridge to reach cairn isle. you can fall and take a lot of damage, so a useful trick is to usesurgeto teleport 10 spaces forward and thus cross most of the bridge. however, this is not always successful. once you're on the island, search for some ""well-stacked rocks"" in the northern part and choose to climb down them (you must choose the ""search"" option to be given the option to climb down). you may fail a few times, taking minor damage, but keep trying. you find yourself in a smaller cave. go to the dolmen in the south end of the cavern and search it to get asword pommel, alocating crystalandbervirius notes. use the karamja lodestone and return to trufitus (or exit the tomb by climbing the rocks to the east, and walk back). read the scrolls, then show him everything. he says that you need to make yourself a necklace to be protected from rashiliyia's powers. if you attempt to create the necklace before reading all three scrolls in the bervirius notes, and both scrolls you received in ah za rhoon, you may receive the message 'you're not really sure how this would fit together. perhaps you need some instructions?' use a chisel on the sword pommel to makebone beads; thetool beltwill not work for this. now, use a bronze bar on an anvil to makebronze wire— there is an anvil just north of the village. finally, use the wire on the beads to make thebeads of the deadnecklace. you're now ready to take on the witch queen. before you leave, make sure you use the necklace on trufitus to show it to him. thebervirius notesadd more insights, and come in 3 sections. the tattered yellow papyrus: the decayed white papyrus reveals the meaning of the beads: the crusty orange papyrus finishes the explanation: from tai bwo wannai, go east and cross the agility log over the river, then head north. alternatively, use thefairy ringcodedkpto zip to the north shore, neartiadecheoftai bwo wannai, and then go south. travelling through the fairy rings will take you through zanaris, which has a bank, where you can load up on any food, ammunition, and potions. you may store the scrolls, in case you need extra inventory space, but be sure to keep a chisel, the bone shard and thebeads of the deadnecklace. search for a set of double doors hidden in the foliage, just north of the jogres. after you uncover the doors, search them to convert your bone shard, with the help of a chisel, into abone key. clear away the foliage from the door and use the bone key on it, and it will open only slightly, but enough to allow you to enter. go through the doors, with the necklace now equipped, to enterrashiliyia's tomb. if you do not enter quickly, the foliage will re-cover the door, forcing you to remove the key and use it on the door again. if you do not have the beads of the dead necklace on when you enter the dungeon, rashiliyia's ghost will appear and attack you once, damaging for 10% of your current life points. she will then send someundead onesto attack you as well, and disappear. just kill these like you normally would, avoid their harmful gas. equip the beads of the dead to be able to pass through theancient metal gate. you'll find undead ones all throughout the dungeon – more will be summoned if you pick up thecoins, which turn to dust on touch. go through the ancient gates and down therockslope, before heading south-west until you findtomb doorswith skeletons embedded in them. they seem to have receptacles for bones; use 3 regular bones on these doors. be careful not to bury the bones by mistake! ensure you are wearing the beads of the dead, prepare for battle, then search the dolmen inside the tomb. you will be attacked bynazastarool, a level 53 zombie. after you defeat him, he'll turn into a level 53 skeleton. after you defeat him, he'll once again change, this time into a level 53 ghost. once you've defeated the ghost, you'll getrashiliyia's corpse. battle notes and tips: when you take the corpse, never drop it! rashiliyia's spirit will thank you for releasing her and you will need to go back to her tomb and kill all 3 of the forms again. to leave, simply use the home teleport to karamja. (if you try to exit through the dungeon without the key, you get a humorous dialogue: ""oh no, i'm going to be stuck in here forever!"" ""how will i ever get out!"" ""i'm too young to die!"") it is not necessary, but if you show the corpse to trufitus, he'll tell you to think – perhaps there's a clue in the items you have? there are a couple, actually. you know rashiliyia wishes to be reunited with her son, that the cairn island dolmen is ideally placed for containing the spirits of witches and undead, and that rashiliyia was a witch. go back to the tomb of bervirius on cairn isle,  head to the dolmen, and use the corpse on it; rashiliyia will appear and thank you for letting her rest in peace, saying thatzamoraktricked her and returned her son as an undead creature. she goes on: ""...my hatred and bitterness corrupted me. i tried to destroy all life... now i am released... and am grateful to contemplate eternal rest..."" she disappears and gives you a reward. quest complete. shilo village is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

in replays, the player will be able to make different choices to see how they would have affected the quest's conclusion. replays were added to the game on29 january2018, just over one year after the quest was released.[1] but one thing is for certain - your actions will have a direct effect on the outcome, and will be reflected in future content. choose wisely! to start the quest, speak torelomiaindraynor village. she will tell you that sliske's endgame is near, and ask you to invite all the gods to the grand finale. they can be found in the following locations: you may also findsliskeinside vorago's cave during the search for the gods. choices that could affect outcome of the game: once everyone has been invited, return to draynor and talk to relomia. she will tell you to prepare for a possible fight and will tell you to meet her outside at theheart'sencampment. this is the outer encampment, not the ones inside. while you can bring a familiar to the encampment, familiars are not allowed into the event and you will be asked to dismiss it before continuing. once you are geared up, speak torelomiaat the heart encampment. all of the other participants will appear and argue before sliske arrives. he reveals that he has invited thedragonkinsince they killed the godv.brassica primeandmarimbowill both leave, as they have no interest in the stone. you are presented with more choices here: yet another battle with nomad the dragonkin arrive brassica prime and marimbo decide to leave sliske unleashes nomad sliskewill then reveal that he created a ""world guardian"" fromnomad, and that it will count as a kill for your god if you defeat him. this fight is much easier than fights with nomad in previous quests - he only attacks with normal magic attacks, not usually hitting more than 1000 but rarely up to 2000, and lower if youpray against magic. food is still recommended for all players, though. stuns do not work. if you struggle with this fight,vampyrism auraandsoul splithelp make up for the lost health, as do blood spells. once nomad is defeated sliske will send the party members into his labyrinth, including you. you should leave at least one inventory space for the puzzles as anything you drop will disappear as soon as you finish the puzzle - you won't need more than four free spaces. you will need a weapon to kill some easy enemies in the puzzles. you can exit at the start of the first wave of the fight after the labyrinth to restock, though most players should be able to complete that wave with minimal supplies and restock at the beginning of the second wave. sliske's labyrinthcan take very long to complete, so make sure you have enough time to complete it. if you leave the labyrinth through the exit portal or lobbying, speak torelomiaagain, who will drop you off at your previous location inside. the labyrinth is actually two labyrinths that must be completed in order; the first labyrinth ends with a big swirly portal, whilst the second and final labyrinth ends with a set of stairs. in both labyrinths, you are travelling from the southwestern room to the northeastern room. each labyrinth has 4 sections (2x2) each consisting of 8x8 rooms. only the rooms in the section you are currently in are visible on the map, the other sections become visible when you enter the purple door that leads you to another section. since your only viable option to finding your way in this maze is by using the map, it is a good idea to increase the size of your minimap to give you a much better overview. make sure your compass is pointing north after changing sections. your run energy will stay at 100% while you are in the labyrinth. a common tip in the labyrinth is to look for large rooms in your map, aligned with glowing barriers ingame and find your way there, where you will either get a cutscene or have a puzzle to complete. the cutscenes have little impact on the quest, but the puzzles do. when you complete the puzzle, doors or new paths will open further down the path that were previously blocked or empty. the gods progress through the labyrinth each time you pass between rooms. after a total of 189 passes one of them reaches the end of the first labyrinth, getting to pick another god to lose their entourage which possibly affects future lore encounters. if the player reaches this point first, they get the same choice. inside the labyrinth the end of the first labyrinth be sure to follow the cyan lines on the first solution, they lead to puzzle and cutscene rooms off the main map that must be completed to progress along the map later. go back to the green path once the puzzle is done. all orange paths lead to additional cutscenes, but are not required to complete the quest. upon reaching the final room, one can simply climb the stairs to advance. solving the puzzle rooms rotate one room in the maze counter-clockwise once each, opening paths further through the maze. not all puzzles need to be completed to get through the mazes, depending on the route you take. a solution to the first maze a solution to the second maze an example of a false map section above a real map section there are several puzzles you can encounter: choices given in the labyrinth do not affect the maze itself, but may affect later outcomes and future quests. choices include: saradomin and his entourage encounter seren. zaros and his entourage encounter zamorak. once you reach the end of the second labyrinth, climb up the set of staircases. at the top of the staircase, you will be met by another god, with whom you will race to thestone of jas. the race works the same way regardless of who you're racing. the one who reaches the stone of jas first will be declared the victor ofsliske'sendgame. you may race againstarmadyl,saradomin, orzamorak, based on how well you and each of them perform in the labyrinth. you are most likely to race against armadyl, who had the highest score onsliske's scoreboard, and thus started the endgame with an advantage; you are least likely to race against zamorak, who had the lowest score on sliske's scoreboard, and thus started the endgame with a disadvantage. sliske will give you a ""headstart"" of sorts, binding the opponent for a short time. make your way towards the stone of jas. the next part of the quest will differ based on who wins. if you want to win, click on the ""delay"" switches along the way, before your opponent passes them, to slow down your opponent; the ""delay"" switches temporarily summon sliske's apparitions to block the god's path. you will have to go through the following sequence to reach the stone of jas: once the stone is reached, sliske arrives, and a victor is declared. if you are the victor, you can state what you plan to do with the stone of jas. in all cases, you will be given a chance to react to the end result.zarosandserenwill then teleport inside, to sliske's great surprise, revealing that their power is greater than sliske's in his attempt to kick them out. what happens at this point will depend upon your choices during the quest as well as in previous quests. if zamorak wins, zaros will invoke thedemon pactthat he made with zamorak inchildren of mah, demanding the stone of jas from zamorak. if armadyl or saradomin wins, zaros will reveal that he has made a similar demon pact to bind them. for armadyl, zaros promises to protect the aviansie, in exchange for the stone of jas. for saradomin, zaros has rescuedhis daughterand held her captive withnex, agreeing to return her safely to saradomin in exchange for the stone of jas. if seren is restored with the dark shard inthe light within, she will reweave the threads of fate that bound armadyl or saradomin to zaros in the demon pact, freeing them from zaros and binding them to herself. for armadyl, seren agrees to fulfil zaros's obligations to protect the aviansie. for saradomin, seren reveals that her agents have taken saradomin's daughter from nex, are keeping her safely whilst the endgame is in progress, and will return her to saradomin afterwards. if zaros is sabotaged infate of the gods, seren's pact stands. armadyl or saradomin agree to fulfil their end of the agreement, and seren agrees to uphold hers. zaros protests, saying that he needs the stone of jas to fulfil his plans, to which seren responds that his plans are exactly why she must keep the stone of jas away from him. if zaros is fully restored in fate of the gods, the outcome will vary based on other choices made in the game. in some cases, seren's pact will still win. in other cases, zaros will have the foresight to see what seren does, and nullifies seren's attempt to unbind armadyl or saradomin from him. armadyl or saradomin will feel as if nothing has happened, and zaros's demon pact still stands. if seren is restored without the dark shard in the light within, seren will not attempt to reweave the threads of fate that bind armadyl or saradomin to zaros. regardless of whether she was restored with the dark shard or not, seren makes no attempt to rebind zamorak's demon pact with zaros. in all of these cases, zaros's demon pact stands. armadyl or saradomin agree to fulfil their end of the bargain by handing over the stone of jas to zaros. if you win, zaros warns you that should you take the stone, you will set in motion the destruction ofgielinordue to another god war, one that will eventually spread to the rest of all creation. he admits to being fond of the world guardian and convinced of their importance in a prosperous future, but demands that you hand over the stone to him or he will be forced to destroy you. regardless of what happens, at this point,kerapacwill suddenly appear and destroy the stone of jas withthe mirror. kerapac arrives and prepares to destroy the stone of jas. kerapac zaps the stone with the mirror. the stone explodes. enraged,sliskewill attempt to kill you in battle. if you were not fully equipped for the battle while in the maze, need to restock, change equipment or obtain a familiar, you can leave through the exit portal (teleportation will not work); simply talk torelomiaagain outside the heart encampment to return. each wave serves as a checkpoint. deaths here are not safe. upon death, yourgravestoneappears outside theheart of gielinor. using thenardahteleport from thedesert amulet, the gravestone can be easily reached to reclaim items without having to paydeath. it is recommended to read through the next 3 waves before continuing the quest, as you will constantly be under attack for an extended period of time. sliske will send standardwight footsoldiersandarchersat you. kill them to fill the bar. as the bar progresses, he will start sendingimbued wight footsoldiers, who are stronger but still weak enough to kill. as you kill more wights, he will start addingunstable wight footsoldiers, who are similar to the imbued ones but explode upon death, dealing damage to anything near it. keep killing wights until the bar fills. it is recommended to use either barrage spells to clear the crowd as fast as possible, or if using melee or range to chain as many area-of-effect abilities as you can. be aware that all remaining unstable wight footsoldiers will explode at the end of the wave, potentially causing death if the player is surrounded. if you do die from the unstable wights at the end of the wave, you will still continue to the next wave when you re-enter the quest after respawning. angered by your resistance,sliskewill summon thebarrows brothersto attack you. due to your actions inkindred spirits, the brothers defect and support you. sliske states he never plays all his cards and calls uponnomad,gregorovicandlinza the disgraced. you will need to defeat all three to progress. nomad uses his standard auto-attacks and will also place mines around you occasionally, which you should avoid stepping on. if you step on a mine, you will take massive damage and lose all of your run energy. if gregorovic/linza is defeated, nomad will occasionally release a powerful attack that deals about half of the player's currentlife pointsworth of damage, which can be completely blocked withprotect from magicanddevotionor healed from withresonance. when nomad is the last one remaining, he will summon several clones of himself, though you only need to defeat one to progress. nomad has 100,000 life points. gregorovic will summona healing spirit, which will heal him for 10,000 life points if it touches him. simply attacking the spirit is enough to force it away from him; make sure you hit or the spirit will continue towards gregorovic. if nomad/linza is defeated, gregorovic will also start using his knife throw attack; this will be indicated by shadows on the ground, so move when necessary to avoid unblockable damage. when gregorovic is the last one remaining, he will be able to use his shadow clones to assist him. each shadow clone has 3,000 life points. gregorovic has 200,000 life points; his fight is extremely similar to that in the heart; the only difference is that he does not hit as hard, cannot poison you, and does not use his knife trick attack. however, he will summon his shadow clones frequently, and not when he is at a set health like when he does so in the heart, so abilities that can hit multiple targets will be vital if you want to mitigate the damage gregorovic's shadow clones can inflict. linza will be able to bind you for several seconds, in addition to her set's effect of reflecting back damage. if nomad/gregorovic is defeated, linza will be able to perform a defensive stance and heal for 1,500 every few ticks, in a manner similar toaraxxor's web shield. this defensive stance can be stopped if she is hit for enough damage, so use threshold and ultimate abilities if possible. if she is the last one remaining, she will unleash a large-area attack similar toquake- simply move out of range to avoid taking heavy damage. however, be wary and have thefreedomability ready, as she could bind you before she unleashes this attack. linza has 150,000 life points. she is the only target of the three with a weakness, being vulnerable to fire spells. pick off one of the targets at a time; when you defeat them, the others will recover all their health and gain new abilities. once all three are defeated,sliskewill personally face you. a good strategy for this fight is to take out eithernomadorgregorovicfirst, as they are much harder to defeat if killed last, whereaslinzadeals the least amount of damage and has the least effective and extreme additional attacks when last remaining. it is possible to safe-spot linza if she is the last to be fought, before she charges her area attack lure her next to a rift, and when she charges go to the other side with some distance, and she cannot reach you afterwards, while you can use magic and ranged attack across the rift, although you should still keep note of your hitpoint due to deflection damage. leaving gregorovic for last is not recommended as his shadow clone attack occurs every few seconds which in addition to increased healing from his summon can result in him healing quicker than you can damage him. it is possible to run between the portal nomad spawns at and the portal gregorovic spawns at while sliske is talking, trapping linza behind the middle portal when they spawn. after nomad and gregorovic are defeated, the middle portal serves as a safe spot against linza if using ranged or magic. it is possible to usedeathtouched dartsin this phase to skip it. baffled by the defeat of his strongest wights,sliskewill engage you personally. he has 100,000life points(but regains health three times, for a total of 400,000, of which the last 100,000 are after you become invincible), and attacks with magic, using the spellshadow blitz. while sliske is not weak to any attack style,ranged armourmay be beneficial for defence against sliske's magic attack, or use thedeflect magiccurse. sliske also often drains chunks of your prayer, so using at least 3 to 4super restore/prayer flasksis recommended. sliske also has a unique attack he uses every 20 seconds without warning, where five shadow pit full of hands will emerge where you stand, dealing 25% of your max health as damage every few ticks. this damage cannot be reduced by deflection or protection, unlike his normal attacks. the first 4 pits appear at your current location while the last pit appears at your intended destination, each pit appears in 1.2s interval to total of 6 seconds. this can be avoided by moving out of the way, much likenexshadow phase. it is recommended to use evasive and sporadic manoeuvres here: just keep running for the first four pits, and click around for the fifth. he may also freeze you in place, binding you for a few seconds; usefreedomto escape if this happens. sliske always continues attacking you even when shadow pits are emerging. if the shadows are too hard to see in the smoky environment, a suggestion would be to lower the gameplay graphics in settings. sliske's normal attack is not as strong compared to his special, thus a strategy should be prepared and implemented to help avoid becoming caught unexpectedly.  wave 3 contains multiple parts. these pieces are listed below in order of suggested completion. steps 2, 4, and 6 are interchangeable and may be completed in any order. sliske will unleash a lightning attack during the second of the three options taken. should you die or leave the arena before the checkpoint (step 8) is reached, you must begin at step 1 once again. the order of steps 2, 4, 6 will stay the same for the same player regardless of how many times he challenges sliske. effectively, you will have to fight sliske 4 times at 100,000 health, bringing him down to 10,000. each such fight will be identical. after the fourth fight, there is a checkpoint and a fifth fight where you are invincible. when the phases with lightning is completed, the lightning may not be despawned early, and as such you might take up to 5,000 damage. careful timing on entering portal and climbing the cliff, along with moving away as soon as you return to the main field is possible to prevent damage. a cutscene will begin where you fight sliske with thestaff of armadyl. you get the upper hand and impale sliske on the staff, killing him. however, before succumbing, he manages to force the other end into you and appears to transfer his essence into you. having the last laugh, sliske petrifies and crumbles away as you collapse. fighting sliske using the staff. sliske is successfully stabbed. sliske turns to stone. after sliske's death, you will find yourself on a platform with seren and zaros. a voice speaks out, revealing itself to be theelder godjas. zaros requests jas to make him an elder god, but she refuses, so he leaves in anger. seren follows him. jas will then focus her attention on you, and ask why you killed her agent. explain your actions to jas, who will follow up with more questions. at the end of the conversation, she will consult the other elder gods about life on gielinor; if they prove themselves to be worthy, they will spare gielinor, but if they aren't, they will destroy the planet and all life. jas will allow you to ask her one question before she sends you back. you can insult jas instead; however, if you go all the way through with this option, jas will strike you with an energy bolt for 32,000 hard typeless damage, instantly killing you. this counts as anunsafe death, and your grave will be placed outside of the heart of gielinor. you will find yourself back in the encampment. linza will approach you and apologise for her actions, and decides to stay with the barrows brothers due to being undead. armadyl, saradomin, and/or seren will then approach and ask what it was like in the presence of the elder gods. death and/or icthlarin are the last to speak with you, who will commend you for stopping sliske, although sliske's laugh will emanate and prevent the player from telling them the truth about what they are hearing. icthlarin will also note a strange shadow amongst the player. return to relomia in draynor village and either tell her the truth about sliske or lie. she will become grief-stricken or angry, depending on how players decide to tell her what happened, but the player will black out while sliske's laugh emanates once more. when the player awakens, relomia will be strangely cheerful, and gives players their rewards. congratulations, quest complete!  the ability to replay sliske's endgame was released on29 january2018along with theagent of the eldestoutfit as a reward and the option of one additional canonical playthrough. in order to start a replay, the player must return todraynor villageand talk torelomiaonce again. in order to get theagent of the eldestoutfit, along with amedium prismatic lamp, players must complete one replay of the quest. players may skip the maze and still be eligible for the rewards. however, handing out invitations to each god, the subsequent fight against nomad and completing all three waves of the final fight is required in order to receive any rewards. for non-canonical playthroughs, it is possible to choose which interactions the player will encounter in the maze (ignoring the normal selection criteria from choices and gameplay, unless the ""default"" option has been selected). disconnecting or otherwise logging out will reset these chosen interactions for that playthrough. interactions are divided into two groups of seven: in addition to this, the player can choose who they will face in the final race for the stone of jas (armadyl, saradomin, zamorak or the one determined by the player's choices). after a month of the replayability being released, there were only around 300 people that had replayed the quest, with jagex branding that number as insignificant, and thus have been dissuaded from adding replayability to other quests.[2] jagex has said that a player's canon playthrough will become locked upon starting the next quest to continue on from sliske's endgame.[3] sliske's endgame is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

eligible for a new mission. he tells you to check in with thetemple knights' local agent inwitchaven,col. o'niall, with the password ""in falador, the geese fly backwards on tuesdays."" sir tiffy also provides you with an upgradedcommorb v2. make your way to witchaven using any of thepossible waysand find colonel jake o'niall rocking in a chair on the dock, found in the north-east corner of town. talking to the retired member of the temple knights reveals that some of the villagers have started acting strangely since about three weeks, especiallymayor eustace hobb. he also tells you that some of them are in a dazed and confused state. if you have not already, ask o'niall who the important people are in witchaven. he points you to mayor hobb,brother maledictandholgart, the fisherman, who helped you during thesea slugquest. o'niall also suggests that the others may also have some insight into what has been happening to their fellow-mates. make sure to finish talking to o'naill about who to speak to, or they won't give you the right dialogue. start off by talking to mayor hobb at his house. it is on the west side of town. mayor hobb tells you various things, one of which is about a certain shrine dedicated to saradomin. as you start to leave the house,savantstops you. she notes the mayor is acting a bit fishy and asks you to scan him. inside the mayor's house, choose the scan option on thecommorb v2. she gets an odd reading - two life forms from the mayor - but she is unsure what it means. next, head to the church — just south-east of the mayor — and speak with brother maledict. he tells you he is worried about his flock, who have begun to act a little bit strangely lately, emulating what o'niall had told you. now, walk a little bit north by the shore, and talk to holgart. he tells you that the mayor recently confiscated his boat and gave it to another man namedjeb. he also mentions that thefishing platformlooks a mighty bit stranger and that you should go take a look. report back tocol. jake o'niall, and tell him what you have found out so far. he suggests you take a good look at the shrine. head to the western edge of the village — to the ruins — and climb down the old entrance to get into thewitchaven dungeon, which houses the shrine. once you are in the dungeon, look to the minimap. on the east wall, look for a red section indicating a false wall. choose the push wall option to open this section, and then enter the wall opening. you find yourself in a winding tunnel with aggressivegiant lobstersthat have been possessed by sea slugs. make your way through the tunnel — or save some time and climb through theagilityshortcut30— and head to the imposing doors blocking your way. do not try to open the doors or else a flash of light will spring from them, burning your hand for 50 life points. savant contacts you via the commorb v2 to ask you to take a scan of the strange markings on the door. choose the scan option on the commorb v2. she says they look similar to some saradomin glyphs she studied at the academy. she gives you atranscript of the runesto take tojorral, who can translate them. before you go, grab thedead sea slugnearby as it is required later. savant contacts you about the slug you picked up and does a scan to analyse it. travel tojorralat theoutpost, which is north-west ofwest ardougneand south of thetree gnome stronghold. talk to him about translations.savantpops up in the commorb v2 and coaches you on how to get jorral to translate the message. eventually, jorral takes a look at the text and says it refers to a great battle between the temple of saradomin and an evil creature calledmahey'ish medron, or as she more commonly called, the mother mallum. after jorral is done, savant contacts you again to catch you up on what she has learned about mother mallum. head back towitchaven, and check in with o'niall. he suggests you speak with brother maledict to see if he knows anything about mallum. approach the church's door, and you see a briefcutsceneof the mayor leaving the chapel. when you enter the church, the priest is wobbling around, looking rather ill and acting strangely. talk to him about what is behind the imposing doors you found and he tells you he has a book that has information on how to keep mother mallum trapped, but someone has stolen the three pages pertaining to the shrine's history and it is imperative you recover them immediately. if for whatever reason you have lost or dropped the dead sea slug, an infinite number spawn outside the door with the strange markings in the shrine. be sure not to try to pick a livesea slug, however, because it will bite you, dealing 20-30 life points of damage. move the three pieces of the page around using the controls over in the bottom-right corner of your screen: the easiest way to tell if you have got them all on the right side is that the correct side is lighter than the other. the image to the right gives you a general idea of how the fragments should fit together. the third piece may be out of view at the very bottom; select the third piece and click the up button several times to bring it in view. when you put the pieces in their correct place, the puzzle fragments will close automatically, forming thelast page. now talk tojebon the dock and have him take you back towitchaven. it is possible to fail while shaping or empowering an essence and break it, so it is advised to shape them at each altar in case you fail to empower and break the blank rune. right click and choose the shape option from the three pages to create a blank rune. take each of the blank runes to its associatedaltar, and use it on their respective altar: the blank earth rune on the earth altar, and so on. take caution as to not click on the altar, as your essence may be crafted into runes. once complete, your inventory should contain special misshapen counterparts of the elemental runes. when ready, go back to the shrine and return to the imposing doors. use each of the specially-shaped runes you made on the doors to trigger a cutscene. you see that mayor hobb tricked you into opening the door so thatmother mallumcould escape. following the cutscene, you must fight a level 51slug prince. the prince is immune to necromancy, magic and ranged attacks and should only be fought using melee. a slashing weapon is recommended to take advantage of his weakness, with ahalberdbeing the best option as it enables you to kill the prince without taking damage. after you kill the prince, you see another cutscene with mother mallum. she threatens to make you her new host, butsavantpops in via the commorb v2 and teleports you safely tofalador park. talk to sir tiffy to be promoted to a proselyte for your efforts. congratulations, quest complete! mother mallum appears! mother mallum expresses her desire to take you as her new host. savant teleports you away from mother mallum, after multiple failed

after you've destroyed the door, do not walk into the room yet. traps on the walls can hit 1300+life points, so disarming the traps first would be a great idea. on the wall of one side of the corridor before each set of traps is a rectangular switch. searching the wall (not the odd markings) temporarily disables the traps. the message in the chat box is ""with a subtle grinding sound, a hidden mechanism operates just ahead of you. you'd best make your move now."" once you have passed two sets of traps, open the door at the end of the hall and enter the room. the room has two low levelzombiesandskeletons. they have varied combat levels, but neither is a serious threat. they have 450 life points, so a few abilities should kill them regardless of style. once you've killed the zombies and skeletons, wait a moment. a level 77mummy warriorwill climb out of the central tomb. the zombies and skeletons respawn fairly quickly. if you find it difficult to keep all four dead at one time, try to either use their weaknesses against them or area abilities such asricochetwhen they are grouped together. the mummy warrior does not awaken unless all four are dead simultaneously. he's not much of a threat to those with higher combat levels. kill themummy warriorand pick up the key—it will either be amagic path keyor aranged path key, depending on which path was chosen. make sure you are not in a group, otherwise the key will not drop. now, use the key to open the door, and once inside, pull the lever. walk back out to the centre again. you will not set off traps on this side any more after you have pulled the lever, and the skeletons will not rise and attack you. if you did the ranged side, now it's time to do the mage side or vice versa. don't forget to disarm the traps in the second room! once you've pulled the levers on both sides, the traps in the centre pathway are disabled too. go back to the centre and walk over the disabled traps. with the traps, clicking ""pass"" or ""search"" should tell you that they're disabled. walking over them is all you need to do. after you pass the traps, you will reach the dead slayer mastercatolax. equip yourghostspeak amulet, and talk to him. you have a ""momentary insight, from a source that is completely unknown"" and then know how to combine aface maskwith a pair ofearmuffs. go to the bank (the nearest being in nardah), get your supplies, and make your way back to the well in pollnivneach. if you have not made it already, take your earmuffs and use them with your face mask to get a new item, themasked earmuffs. put on your masked earmuffs, and go down the well into thepollnivneach slayer dungeon. head north, and kill a level 61mighty bansheeto get abanshee voice. if you don't get it the first time, keep trying as it is not a rare drop. they are weak to arrows. they are aggressive, use powerful magic attacks that hit up to 1300 and are much stronger than previous monsters, soprotect from magicis recommended, especially for low level players. use the banshee voice on the blue/purplewavering mystic barrierdirectly to the north. do not click on anything else while the cutscene is in motion or you will go back outside the barrier and will need to acquire another banshee voice! however, after you kill thebanshee mistress, there will be another cutscene. if you click on anything else, you will go outside the barrier, but will not have to fight again; you can easily go back inside the barrier to continue the last cutscene. you see a cutscene showingjesmona, the damsel in distress, level 81insectoid assassins, and a level 93banshee mistress. the banshee mistress will attack you as soon as the cutscene ends, so be sure to heal if needed and turn on protection prayers. the banshee mistress will frequently sound an acoustic attack, which deals 20% of maximum life point damage and knock you down. a lot of food, preferablylobsteror above, is needed. you can also bring a combat familiar here. she is weak to bolts, so a tier 40+crossboworsalamanderis highly recommended, followed by any other ranged weapon. the mistress mainly uses melee, but she also castswater blastat a distance, so using theprotect from meleeprayer for the first half of the fight is suggested, orprotect from magicif fighting at a distance. her basic attacks are weak however compared to the typeless special attack. the banshee mistress will say ""minions, aid me!"" upon falling below half health. this is your sign to turn on theprotect from rangedprayer, asinsectoid assassinswould answer her call and hit you with rapid ranged attacks. if you die when fighting the mistress, you will be able to go back to yourgravestoneand retrieve your items. your gravestone will spawn outside of the well, so getting to your lost items isn't such a big problem. however, you will have to kill another mighty banshee to obtain the banshee voice again. if the mistress dies at the same time, you don't need to fight her again. after you kill the mistress, you see a short cutscene of jesmona being visibly angry before teleporting away, andcatolaxthen speaks to you. you do not need yourghostspeak amuletto understand him on this occasion. return and report your victory to sumona in pollnivneach. congratulations, quest complete!

(ping and pong count as a single entity during this part of the quest. although they have separate progress bars for noise, clicking on one of them encourages both. you still need to repeatedly click on all four characters individually to progress though.) after 3 angry dialogues from the walrus, he will grow increasingly annoyed, and eventually will approach the penguins to complain. when he walks outside, click through his dialogue until your character says you should go inside and get the egg. if you try to enter his tent before clicking through the walrus' dialogue the cut scene will end and you will find yourself back at the gates to the camp. if this happens, simply attempt to enter the walrus' tent and he will come out again. enter the tent and steal from the table to get theegg. walk out and give it to larry. talk to teddy after that. he will ask you to talk to all 6 unnamed penguins to gather ideas on how to escape. talk to teddy then talk to the 6 penguins. there are four wandering in the central area, one hidden between the buildings to the north of larry, and one in the northeast corner near a fishing hole. report back to teddy after speaking to all 6 penguins. he will tell you to talk to the older penguin, who turns out to beplaza, the chess playing penguin by the kitchen. plaza gives you alistabout how to make battlefish - a battleship style board game. here are the steps for gathering the supplies for the game set: once you have all the supplies: give the blueprints to teddy. he tells you that there is a problem with the engine. after going through the dialogue, return toastoriaand ask her for help. she will only provide help if you defeat her in a game of battlefish. if you've played battleship, this should be relatively easy. the shortest piece in the game is 3 squares - therefore, you should space your shots out by 2 (vertically and horizontally) from your previous shot if it is a miss. a good starting method is to hit the centre first (e5, e6, f5, f6) since there is almost always a ship there. fire at only one of these 4 spots. assuming you chose e5, your next shots would be b5, h5, e2, and e8. slowly work your way out from there by choosing shots that are 2 squares apart. if you get a hit, check the squares to the north, south, east and west of it until you get another hit, then continue that way. if you get a miss, go the opposite direction. example: say you have a hit at e5 and e6, but get a miss at e7, reverse direction would be e4, as that is the next square in line with the other hits. see below for an example of how to implement the 2 square spacing. also, if you manage to sink both 3 square pieces and still have to find one or both 4 square pieces, you can change the space between the squares to 3. ai can place the battlefish at the edges. if astoria says, ""ha! you missed!"", it's an indication that one of her battlefish is close to your last shot (usually around two to three spaces away). if you happen to fail, but have hit a battlefish, the battlefish will still be in the same spot when you restart. after defeating astoria in battlefish, go to the circus supplies storage building directly south. search the circus prop crate to recovercircus props(a single inventory item) and return to teddy. you will then have to repair the engine of the submarine. when done, talk to teddy again. ping and pong's rock show. noodle blows up the pow camp. there are two ways to attack the end puzzle of the quest. either keep workers assigned to fixing the sub and hope to torpedo the other ships, or try to destroy the other ships by winning the battlefish game before your own ship is destroyed. it's paramount to keep your workers assigned to fixing the sub, as the bars will decrease if no worker is assigned to them. players should keep an eye on the characters, as their spawning rate is quite fast. as soon as you see that they have regained the ability to work again (a full blue bar, rather than orange) you can assign them to another role. if their bars are not as blue, you may still assign them roles. this will simply cause them to stop working sooner. continue to play battlefish while doing this (you return to the board by looking through the periscope in the left room). teddy will alert you when it is your turn. if you are too busy assigning roles or simply not on the game screen, you will randomly fire at a spot on the board if someone is assigned to torpedoes. over time, the submarine will gradually lose health. getting hit will decrease your sub's maximum health. you can regain health by repairing the ship where needed, but once your maximum health decreases, there's no way to get it back up unless you die or log out. the health bar is reset for every seal ship you destroy. this means finding the opposing ships should be the first objective. the enemy battlefish are located at horizontal 1h - 1j, horizontal 4d - 4g, and vertical f6 - f9. if you are spam clicking on those squares, you will get a hit as soon as it is your turn, and destroying an enemy sub will heal you fully, letting you just spam click to completion. unlike the previous game, the seals have two size 4 ships and one size 3 ship. try centre and upper right first. when you find most squares of a ship, hunt for other ships until your health is low, and then finish destroying that first ship. your health is fully restored every time you sink a ship. this will give you enough time to win the game. if you accidentally click outside the game and it exits, you can re-enter by opening the door to the left and clicking on the periscope. though it does not always work, it is possible to win without assigning any roles by finishing the game of battlefish as quickly as possible.  this requires <10 mistakes and quick clicking on the player's part.  the submarine will lose almost all health, but the quest will be completed nonetheless. clicking on the pop-up message that appears when you hit, miss, or sink a battlefish will make it disappear faster, causing this part to move much quicker than just waiting each time for the message to disappear. (not clicking will make you wait about 4 seconds until you or the seals make a move. clicking on the pop-up will cut down the 4-second waiting time) if you die you will appear in front of the grim reaper with ping and pong. after a short dialogue, leave through the portal and you will appear near the boat to travel to the iceberg. wake the sleeping seal to return to the sub, where you start over. logging out will change the positions of the enemy ships. enemy ships may stay in the same location after death so check those areas first. remember, you must get all ships in one go. you may retry shortly after by waking the sleeping seal. when you destroy all of the enemy ships, you are taken back to the ardougne zoo, and after a short cutscene, the quest is completed. some like it cold is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: a blank battlefish game board a battlefish game in action larry's egg, sheldon, hatches.

you must make it reach 100% for the door to open. to do this, you'll have to find two more symbols that look like the one you stepped on during the cutscene: a doorway will form in a random corner of the room, (it's different for everyone) . enter it and you'll have to find three more symbols: with every symbol you find, the voice will tell you a little more of the story. another doorway will appear in a random corner; enter it. note: if you log out and then you log in you will appear inlucille's house. when you drink the restless sleep potion you will appear in the part you were at. follow the dreaming souls through another doorway. you will enter a room through a cutscene with four elemental pots and a sapling. the haunting voice will help you – the main idea is to nurse the burning sapling back into a healthy tree: if you step through the incorrect doorway or placed the sapling incorrectly (or both), then you will be prompted upon entry to return to the previous room to retry the step. you can also leave the room, which will reset the progress to the most correct one to try again. now go north and enter the doorway. a cutscene will ensue where the dreaming souls fall down a chasm, and the raptor follows. follow them and you'll be eaten by thequeen black dragon. inside, follow the chasms through several openings. be careful not to step into the green acid since it will cause periodic damage. there are also several level 1grotwormsandflying leeches, however they are not aggressive. eventually you will find the siren, imprisoned in a sac and placed under the illusion that she is still on her island where singing would not lure men to their death. go through the interactive cutscene. the dragon that ate you has apparently tricked her into singing others' souls towards her. at first she won't believe the player who said they are in the belly of a dragon, but she sings a song of awakening in an attempt to make the player see the reality – but it instead frees the souls and herself from the illusion. she offers to help you escape if you free her. however, a cutscene shows the raptor enter, who intends to kill the siren. luckily, however, talking to him allows you to dissuade him from killing her by the fact that he can't escape without her aid. now you will grab thecoral crossbowon the floor and burst the cyst (no ammo is required), causing the dragon to vomit the three of you out.remora, the siren, will find her necklace, but will be promptlyburnedto death by the dragon. while the raptor's shield protects you, you grab the necklace, and both you and the raptor will teleport out to safety. bursting the sac remora is contained in thequeen black dragonspitting you, remora and the raptor out remora being killed by thequeen black dragon the raptor blocking the dragonfire from thequeen black dragon the raptor will say that you should go tell lucille about the events while he goes off to kill the dragon. he'll give youremora's necklace, acoral crossbow, and 50coral boltsbefore sending you off. head southwest to rimmington and report to lucille. congratulations! quest complete! song from the depths is not currently required for any quests or miniquests."

east ofvarrock, just south of theearth altar, speak tolauna. alternatively, take a glider to thevarrock dig siteor use adig site pendantorarchaeology journaland walk northwest. there is already a rope attached to the rift, click on it and climb down into the rift. there are several ""rooms"" which players need to get through to complete the quest. it's worth noting here that this quest does not need to be done all at once - each room has an exit which will take you back to the top of the rift and allow you to enter again at a different time. it will remember the rooms you have completed. completing the cutscene of this section will grant attack xp! this room represents tolna's anger and frustrates players because they sometimes have trouble hitting monsters with certain weapons. there are 4 types of monster in this room, and each can only be attacked with a specific weapon. when players enter this room they should see a weapons rack. players should remove their own weapon, select a weapon from the rack that corresponds to a nearby creature, and wield it instead. creatures can only be damaged with the anger weapon that corresponds to that specific creature, and a player may only have one anger weapon in their possession at a time. the player must first remove all of their own gear and only wield the anger weapon. players can do large amounts of damage on these creatures relative to the stats of the weapon, as the player does 10x of their normal damage with that weapon, with a maximum of 1,250 damage (the monster's total life points). each creature killed raises the ""rage level"" bar at the top of the screen. after several kills of the player's choice of angry creatures, the bar will reach maximum and the player will yell, swirl, and kill all remaining monsters in the room. a cut scene in which the boy leaves his mother for the more lucrative mines follows, and players can then exit out of the rage room near the east end of the cave and go into the fear room. this room represents tolna's fear by giving players a frightening jolt when they do not know whether afear reaperwill attack. in this room, players must search the dark holes to find and kill the fear reaper. the fear reaper will be in one of the 6 dark holes that you can ""look-inside"". once you have found and killed it, it will move to another dark hole at random. every time your player kills a fear reaper, they will become less afraid of the creature. note that your progress will reset if you exit tolna's rift by any means (including logging out). after you've killed five you will get another cutscene and one of theblack holeswill turn into an exit. go into this for the next room. tip: the fastest method to complete this room is to check every dark hole moving in a clockwise direction around the room. when you kill a fear reaper, remember to re-check the hole it came out of, as it could have randomly moved to the same hole. this room represents tolna's confusion by flabbergasting players, because doors lead nowhere and some beasts cannot be hurt. the key to pass this room is not related to any of the 6 ""confusing doors"", but the fiveconfusion beasts. four are fake. upon attacking them the player receives a message, ""does this creature really exist?"" as the player's attack registers 0 damage. after hitting them 8 times and not doing any damage, they will disappear with the message, ""that monster wasn't even real!"" when you kill the authentic creature, there will be a message, ""those other monsters were just hallucinations!"" once you kill the realbeast, all 5 will respawn and one of the confusion doors will disappear. upon any respawn, the location of the authentic beast becomes randomised. fortunately, the authentic beast is fairly easy to determine. it is the only one that takes damage, the life points bar shows above its head and is the only one that makes a sound when it is hit. further, if the player is low level the real beast will be the only one whose level is in yellow instead of green. this may or may not be in effect for higher level players. killing the authentic beast produces a respawn of all 5 creatures. before theevolution of combat, a player could only attack one beast at a time due to single way combat. but this is no longer the case, and therefore high level players will find it easiest to attack each confusion beast in rapid succession until the real beast is found. you must kill the real beast 5 times before the next flashback appears (where the boy finds himself alone in the cave, feeling ""hopeless"") and you are allowed to leave through the only ""confusing door"" left after the other 5 disappear. if a player is finding it hard to determine the real creature, because they have low accuracy and it is taking too long to make the creature disappear, one can trap a creature behind a door, and use a ranged or magic attack to attract another monster, to test if it is the real one. this room represents tolna's hopelessness, because some players give up when thehopeless creatureswon't die and the bridge may not appear. in this room, players will find fivehopeless creatures. each has three forms and therefore needs to be killed three times to make them die permanently. the hopeless creatures will get smaller every time you kill them. an easy way to kill them quickly is to usedwarf multicannonafterdwarf cannonquest. warning: you will lose the cannon but can get new one fromnulodionfor free. players are not advised to eat while fighting these as eating anything will heal the creature 75% of its current life points, although higher levels shouldn't need to eat at all in this part. when they have all been killed, thebridge of hopewill appear. after crossing the bridge, players will see a short cutscene involvingtolna's father pleading with his son, and then must defeat the inhuman version oftolna, a three-headed monster. each of the three level 39 heads can attack with eitherrangeormeleeand poison. they are easier to defeat with range ormagicrather than melee as attacking any head with melee will place the player in range of all three heads which will then attack simultaneously. players with a higherconstitutionlevel will have no problem with any choice of attack.protect from meleeordeflect meleemay be used for players to safely melee the monsters. if using magic, avoid using fire spells due to the fact that the heads have an immunity to fire. after you fire your first fire spell at one of the heads, an immunity to fire symbol appears below the health bar on said head.
once you have defeated the heads, tolna will become human again and thank you. talk to him and he will return you to the surface. talk to him again on the surface to complete the quest and receive your reward. congratulations, quest complete! should players go into the dungeon (after the quest), they will enter what looks like a waiting room, able to walk into 1 of the 4 rooms (representing tolna's rage, fear, confusion, and hopelessness) and train on the creatures there. the creatures in these rooms do not behave the same as they did before. the hopeless creatures can only be killed once, the rage creatures are at easier levels to fight, can be hit with any weapon and do not receive ludicrous amounts of damage, the confusion beasts do not poison, and all of the confusion beasts can be killed. none of the creatures in the rooms drop items, except for the angry giant rats which drop only bones. a soul's bane is not currently required for any quests or miniquests."

by speaking to the spirit north of theinfernal source dig site, before crossing thewilderness wall. you can't understand the spirit, even when wielding an amulet of ghostspeak, though you will get the phrase ""...with..."", which the player interprets as a signal to come with the spirit. the spirit will teleport you to a safe version of the wilderness. follow her. as you walk toward the spirit, she will disappear and reappear a short ways away. continue to walk toward her until you get a message:you feel as if something is pulling at your consciousness. do you allow it to drag you away?agree to enter thespirit realm. you see a man (later known aserik bonde) who traps the girl in 5 rings. equip theghostspeak amuletand talk to the man. he doesn't speak but rather answers with an emote. the emote responses are different for each player. you will have to speak to him after each emote in order for him to do a new one. if you forget or miss what emote he performs, use thethinkemote or click him once to get him to repeat his emote. each time the correct emote is performed, one of the 5 rings around the girl will disappear. if you respond with an incorrect emote, all the rings reappear, and you must start over. after all 5 rings are gone, speak to the spirit girl. you will find her very hard to understand. if you forgot or otherwise did not bring your ghostspeak amulet, do not go back to the portal by the farm as it will be rendered inoperative. you can come back any time by meeting her where you first followed her, instead. she wants to meet you at a village near the mountains to the west. continue speaking to her and she will take you to the village. the quest is currently bugged and the ghost will often return to his neutral pose after only a small amount of the emote. if that happens speak to him and your characters dialogue will tell you which emote he is using. to return to the ""real world"", talk to the spirit and ask her to take you back. talk to her again to return to the spirit world. items needed:below are the locations for the items you will need that can be found around the ruins in the real world, but it is likely faster to buy all the items at thegrand exchange. when in the real world, be sure to grab the mushrooms on the hollowed log to the west of the farming patch near the statue. while you won't need the mushrooms themselves later, picking them up is required. speak to the spirit when you have the items above. she can be found just a little east of the flower patch and directly north of the anvil. talk to the spirit again. she will again not talk properly and mention something like ""being stuck"", ""a beast"", ""washing something"" and ""a barrel"" (indicating the barrel located next to her). the girl wants to clean her face. next to her is an empty barrel. this barrel is filled with water in the real world. empty the barrel in the real world by using a bucket on it. this will fill up the barrel in the spirit realm. now, enter the spirit world again where a cut scene will ensue. the girl will be able to wash her face now. there are two ways to return to the real world. the first is by talking to the spirit and asking her to take you back to the real world. the second is by running toward the outer edges of the spirit world. when asked if you want to leave, you say yes. the spirit now wants something to eat. if you have not already done so, go back to the real world and west of the farming patch. near the statue, pick the hollow log to getbutton mushrooms(this requires three empty inventory spaces, although the mushrooms are not needed for the quest and can be dropped once picked). this will cause mushrooms to grow in the spirit realm. return to the spirit realm where a cut scene ensues. the girl will eat the mushrooms. if you already picked up the mushrooms earlier, the cut scene will play after the spirit washes her face. items needed:two planks, and 4 steel nails. the girl then wants you to get some clothes out of the wardrobe she is standing near. back in the real world, use a plank on the wardrobe with another plank and 4 steel nails (requires level 40 construction). this will break open the wardrobe in the spirit realm. go back to the spirit world and you will see her using the wardrobe. planks can be found all around the farm. hammer and nail spawns are in the buildings southwest and southeast of the farming patch. items needed: limpwurt seed. items recommended:supreme growth potion (leafy) next, she wants to retrieve her doll which is buried under the diseasedlimpwurtplant. once again, go back to the real world. rake up the weeds, then search the nearby crates for alimpwurt seed(or bring your own). having a limpwurt plant already grown in the patch before starting the quest also works. plant and wait for it to grow. it will take around 15–25 minutes. alternatively use asupreme growth potion (leafy)to speed up the process dramatically. the patch won't become diseased, so there is no need to water it, and don't be afraid to do something else while it grows (like smithing some stackable items on the nearby anvil). while it won’t use up the whole 15+ minutes you can kill giant rats to gain bones for the next step. once it is fully grown, the plant in the spirit realm will disappear. go back to the spirit world, where during the cutscene, the spirit girl will get her doll. make sure you don't pick the limpwurt plant, otherwise you will have to grow one all over again! the plant cannot be picked after the doll is retrieved. bones and skulls spawn in the normal realm throughout the farm (where you find the father) or just outside it (use the portal for travelling between the two realms). a skull spawn is also found just east of the farm in the spirit world. you won't be able to see or pick up the skull until after the limpwurt plant has fully grown and you've talked to summer in the spirit realm. after the spirit girl finds her doll, she will begin to speak normally and introduce herself assummer. she will ask you to go with her to the farm. you will have the option of teleporting there if you decide to go immediately. once you are there, talk to summer. she will tell you about analtarthat you need to activate to get rid of thespirit beast. before following her down the steps you should get the skull and bones. you will be led to a ladder (in a building on the east side of the farm) which you can climb down to reach the altar. you need to place offerings on the altar to feed it. use the skull and bones on the altar. make sure you do not bury the bones by accident. summer will tell you that you must use the power of spirits along with the power of the discs in order to trap the spirit beast. if you place the skull and bones on the altar in the real world, they will turn into ashes. if you are experiencing lag, you will not be able to dismiss your familiar quick enough to avoid being devoured. changing your summoning left-click option to ""dismiss"" is recommended in any case. it will be very helpful to have your familiar interface open. from here, you will be able to right click the dismiss button and do ""dismiss now"" to instantly dismiss your familiar. you will not have to go through a confirmation dialogue while in the spirit realm. still in the spirit world, go up to the surface. in the north of the farm ruins is a level 419spirit beast, which you should avoid. east of the beast is a disc with a picture of aspirit wolfon it. stand on the north side of the disc (outside) and summon yourspirit wolfto lure the spirit beast. your familiar needs to be on the disc. wherever the beast is you should stand on the opposite side of the disc. due to a bug, the spirit beast may disappear while you are doing this part. if this happens, log out and back in, then re-enter the spirit realm to respawn it. the beast will approach the first disc from the west. right before the beast steps onto the disc, and your familiar is on the disc, quickly dismiss the spirit wolf. if you are successful, a short cutscene will show a new disc appearing just to the west of the first disc. if the beast devours your familiar quickly summon another and then immediately dismiss it again (make sure you have dismiss set as the left click option); keep doing this until you are successful. the beast does not need to be in the centre of the disk - on top of the disk is enough. repeat this with the new disc, only this time, summon adesert wyrm. again a cutscene will show a new disc appearing if you are successful. summon aspirit scorpionfor the third disc, located at the north-west corner of the farm which is quite a distance from the other two disks. remember, your familiar needs to be on the disc when it is dismissed, or it will not work. in each case, you must dismiss your familiar as soon as the beast is on the disc. take care because if your familiar is not dismissed fast enough, the beast will devour it, requiring you to get another pouch. it may be a good idea to get several of each pouch beforehand. therefore, it is helpful to try to position yourself between the beast and your familiar. the spirit beast won't attack you, so food isn't necessary, but if you get too close to him, you will be hit for low damage (30-80 life points). tips after the beast has had three shocks from the 3 different familiars, three spirits (meranek thanatos,erik bonde, andjallek lenkin) appear and seal it at the last disc. talk to one of the spirits that have trapped the beast, they will explain that by your presence in the spirit realm, you have only made the beast stronger. summer is more appreciative of your help, and gives you hermother's ring. the beast will then escape, and the

threaten him and he will let you in. talk to khnum about getting recruited into the gang, which he is the leader of. to become a part of the gang, he wants you to tell him how you would react to certain 'hypothetical' situations. there are no wrong answers, although each response will decide what title you may get at the end of the quest. once he is satisfied with your responses, he officially recruits you into the skulls. on asking him about the gang's works, he tells you that three of his best men are out performing a kidnapping, and that he can't spare any more details. khnum tells you to meet him up in the gang headquarters for a job, although refuses to tell you its location. he wants you to find it on your own, proving to him that you are indeed skulls material. exit the den and go back to ozan, telling him about everything that transpired below. as he does not know the hq's location either, he suggests following khnum when he goes there to meet you. tail khnum around draynor village, keeping your distance at all times. eventually, he leads you to the abandoned jail east of the village (do not directly go there yourself, you must keep close to khnum or you will lose sight of him). enter the jail to confront khnum. when he finds out that you have been working together with ozan, he explains why he turned over to the dark side. if you lose ozan by any manner, he will go back to the abandoned jail. when ozan was being banished from the city, khnum was wrongly laid off for assisting his friend and letting him inside the palace. khnum, serving loyally for the past twenty years, was devastated and became hateful of the city, and ozan. suddenly,leelaappears, mistaking you and ozan as members of the skulls, ready to shoot her crossbow. after explaining her the situation, you discover that the kidnapping khnum mentioned involves al kharid's prince,ali– he was taken while he was touring lumbridge. you are given a few interrogation techniques to use on khnum – choose the option to let him stay locked up. ozan, using his knowledge of khnum, helps you convince him to give up the kidnapping plan. khnum reveals that they are simply henchmen, working for alady keli, and that they only acted as guides around misthalin, sometimes acting as the muscle. she was supposed to leave via a ship on the south coast of draynor, along with their captor. head south, following the coastline, until you meet up with the kidnappers near the bridge that leads to the wizards' tower. talk to lady keli to initiate another cutscene. keeping a blade on the prince's neck, she warns you to back off. as soon as you refuse, she converts the mercenaries into thralls to fight you before escaping by waters. defeat theskulls mercenariesandjoeand pick up theransom note, which reads as follows: keli has the prince! keli casts a spell the mercenaries are under her control! leela, adamant to get the prince back, requests you to get the news to her father, the spymaster,osman. as he does not trust ozan or you, she gives you a passphrase as a safe passage into the palace quarters. when asked, agree to accompany ozan toal kharid– travel by whatever means are suitable. when inside the city, head up to the palace entrance. try to enter, but the guard refuses to let you under any circumstance. speak to ozan at the foot of the palace steps; fortunately, he is already hatching a plan to make his way into the palace through the rooftops. go to thecrafting storein the north-eastern part of the city and make your way to the top. for all of the steps, you must wait until ozan has also passed the previous obstacle before you can start the next one. if you leave the course in the middle, ozan will be waiting at the palace entrance. talk to him to have him follow you again. however, there may be a bug that causes your character to say you need to wait for ozan when trying to go up the crafting store stairs, despite him already following you. in this case, you have to intentionally make him leave (you can lodestone teleport to al kharid to do so) and go through the course yourself, and ozan will reappear once you reach the palace. sliding on  the awning tip-toeing across the washing line parkour at its best the scaffold jump monkeying around a leap of faith don't look down or die like that guard! just in.. attempt to climb up the brickwork to trigger another cutscene where the menaphite ambassador,jabariis ""negotiating"" with osman, hassan and the emir to put a menaphite on the throne of al kharid, in case the ailing emir dies. the emir instantly abandons the idea of a menaphite ruling al kharid and tells the ambassador that they will find the prince. after the ambassador and the grand vizier leave, the emir and osman discuss the kidnap and the ransom. when osman mentions that the ""kharid-ib"" could be a demand, the emir announces that the kharid-ib must not leave al kharid, though ali must be recovered at any other cost. ozan, opting to keep the prince as the main priority, suggests stealing the ""kharid-ib"". climb the brick-work and break-in through the skylight to the south. inside the treasure room, open one of the ornate chests to obtain the scroll,history of the kharid-ib; read it to understand the logic behind a puzzle. in the centre of the room are 9weights, 8 of which are equal in weight and the final is heavier than the rest. you need to retrieve the odd weight by inspecting and using the nearby het scales. do not click reset before depositing a weight in your backpack, or the game will think that there are no weights on the scale even if you reset the puzzle again. if this happens, relogging should fix the issue. you have exactly two weighings to determine which is the heaviest weight. if you log off, you will find yourself outside the palace. simply talk to ozan again to be taken back into the treasure room. alternatively, you can right-click the statue and ""reset"". use the weight on the kharid-ib display to exchange it with the diamond. as you're doing so, the guards are alerted and a cutscene ensues, where you and ozan are caught by osman. you try to explain, but osman doesn't trust either of you — until you tell him the passphrase that leela told you (if you fail to do so, ozan will eventually say it).  osman, hearing that you indeed work with his daughter, orders his guards to stand down. you hand the diamond over to him and are taken to the emir, who forbids it to be used as ransom. in the ensuing discussion, the emir dies and osman decides to let you and ozan go free — and reinstate ozan with a citizenship. busted! osman remarks wryly. the emir is put out of his misery. stolen hearts is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

each clue will have a blue aura emitting from it indicating it is a point of interest (they are marked on the minimap as red dots). prison clues upon finding all the clues, adrasteia will surmise thatgeneral khazardwas here with some of his soldiers, who were moving an item of important significance. the player will then control khazard. talk to one of thekhazard guardsto begin the puzzle. you must move the largest crate into the ritual circle. you can move the crates and the guards. you can also remove guards by crushing them with the largest crate, which is necessary to solve the puzzle.

then fight him to prove that she is strong and has no need for the gods' faith. the player will control vengeance and fight oreb. he does not have any special attacks and only has 17,500 health. vengeance's stats are based on yours, so a high combat level is useful. the player has access to all one-handed melee, shield defensive and constitution abilities they can use. once oreb reaches 0 health, he surrenders. if the player dies twice, they can skip the fight. adrasteia will then realise something is off but decides to return to the safety of falador castle to discuss the matter further. return to falador castle (falador throne room) wheretrindinewill appear in her alter ego (anne dimitri). she will tell you that bilrach's forces are recruiting at the mage arena and suggests you go there. however, without daemonheim's equipment, there would be no way to do so without attracting suspicion. however, she reveals that a cluster ofargonlike oresurfaced neardaemonheimpeninsula

intoargonlike bars. this can only be done at a furnace in the wilderness; one can be found at theeastern ruins, although players should be wary of aggressivegargoylesin the area. smelt the ore into bars. adrasteia will then tell you that there's an anvil near themage arena, but the path to there is infested with a wide plethora of dangerous and aggressive monsters. she will suggest a safer alternative of using the lever byedgevilleto arrive at thedeserted keep. the fastest way to get there would be aslayer capeand teleporting tomandrith(who's right next to theanvil), with the second fastest being awilderness sword 4, teleport to thewilderness agility courseand running north-east. smith the bars intoargonlike equipment. you will use the 28 bars, to create a set of argonlike equipment for both yourself and adrasteia, but will be forced to make her apickaxeas a weapon due to not having enough bars. she will help you bank any items as you need an empty backpack and proper equipment to proceed. head to the mage arena and talk to vengeance, who will deem the two of you of having potential and asks a few questions to vet your capabilities. if you make an error, simply talk to her again, although you will have to reset from the first question. impressed with your answers, vengeance will allow the two of you to join and send you into a sparring session against bilrach's forces. the enemies drop healing orbs to restore health as needed. once mal is subdued, vengeance will dismiss you for the day, during which you should investigate for four clues in the arena: once all four clues are found, adrasteia will recollect that bilrach went to the mage arena to confrontkolodionfor his knowledge of magic. he offers wealth, but kolodion refuses and wants territory, namely the kingdom ofasgarnia. bilrach states that he is unable to do so, so kolodion refuses the offer. angered, bilrach uses his magic to subdue him. adrasteia will then realise that bilrach intends to combine the ritual marker withteragardianspells and kolodion's magic absorption ability to create a spell that would annihilate half the souls of the human kingdom to empower himself. exit the mage arena; she will then ask to investigate the caves underneath the arena, in which you will find a ritual marker that appears to be nearly complete. investigate the ritual marker. take the rune pouch in the room and open it for a strange-looking fire rune. use it on the sharp rocks in the room to break it into fragments and collect the dust to the north with the empty sack. have adrasteia imbue the runes with unstable energy and plant them on the marker. use the collected dust on the pool to get a soggy sack. click on the ritual marker and use the crushed fire runes. then use the soggy sack.  with the sabotaging complete, step into the sparking pool to the south to return to the falador throne room to begin adrasteia's coronation. a cutscene will ensue where bilrach attempts the ritual with his followers, only for the marker to explode in his and the attendees' faces, ruining his plan and saving the human kingdoms from ruin. at this point, the argonlike armour will be taken from you. note:if you are also part-way through completingtwilight of the gods, it is possible that adrasteia will not be available in the throne room until that quest is completed. back in the falador throne room,adrasteiawill state that she intends to complete her coronation. before she starts, the human ambassadors she invited are squabbling over who should sit where on the table, and thus she asks you to help plan out where they should sit. have the ambassadors sit in the following order:asgarnian,kandarian,menaphite, andmisthalinian. if a mistake is made, the player can reset; adrasteia will also remark if the seating is correct or not as another indicator. a cutscene will then ensue where adrasteia is crowned and addresses her people, who cheer in support as she sings a hallow song to her people. back atzamorak's hideout, moia returns and finds an angered bilrach who accuses her of betraying him by withholding vital information regarding the sabotage. moia states that she didn't need to get involved and that two mortals did so, but he becomes enraged and orders his guards to kill her. forgotten warriors will spawn to attack moia, who has the same abilities as she had indaughter of chaos. kill ten warriors. adrasteia continues her song while moia taunts bilrach over his weakness.zemouregalsteps in and taunts her uselessness over her weaknesses as a half-mahjarrat, but moia reveals otherwise and drains him of energy, leaving him gasping for air. bilrach will order more soldiers to stop her. moia has become empowered and now does twice as much damage. kill twenty guards to proceed. adrasteia continues her song once more, while bilrach demands the others to kill her, but they hesitantly refuse, knowing that bilrach's power is fading. bilrach tells her that they could've worked together, but moia states that she had no intention of serving as his vassal. bilrach commends her for upholding zamorak's values and that the god would've been proud of her, but decides to challenge her himself to prove his strength. as adrasteia finishes up her song, moia prevails over bilrach, causing his soldiers to kneel and swear fealty to her instead. adrasteia speaks to an assembled crowd. adrasteia speaks to an assembled crowd. moia siphons zemouregal's energy, reverting him to his skeletal form. moia stands over bilrach. back at falador castle, the player will experience astrange powerand asks what it was. adrasteia will state that she'll have her spies on it but thanks them for working with her one last time, as she has plenty of paperwork to handle now. congratulations, quest complete! succession is not currently required for any quests or miniquests. bilrach didn't think to inspect the marker before his ritual, and it cost him dearly. he sought the power he felt was owed to him. he dreamed of draining souls from across the world, becoming unrivalled in his power. in a world without gods, he would rule without opposition. unrivalled. untouchable. but it was not to be. your sabotage turned the power bilrach summoned into the marker against itself. magic surged until the structure could contain it no longer. in a great thunderclap, the marker exploded, shattering across the wilderness like a bad dream. the power contained returned to the dirt and the soil. the shards of soul it harnessed returned to the underworld to await their afterlife. bilrach had failed. his plan ruined. his dreams of glory shattered like the marker. in one act of sabotage, the world was safe once more. none even knew they'd been at risk. bilrach's army remained. it was still a threat. still a terrible danger. but the infallibility of his leadership was gone; his authority lost, like his dreams of dominion."

is breaking through the veil separating the two realms. in order to trap the beast, you have to lure it into a mine. however, the mine entrance is closed in the spirit realm. you must destroy the mine entrance in the real realm so that the one in the spirit realm will open. return to the real world by operating jennica's ring while standing on the portal (you must be wearing the ring to operate it). travel north to the mine entrance in the real world (it is marked with a dungeon icon on theminimap), and then collapse the cave in the real world (by right clicking the entrance) before returning to the spirit realm the way you came. additionally, you can optionally search the skeleton just inside the cave for abronze pickaxe, amithril hatchet,tinderboxand aspadein the normal realm. doing so will make the skeleton in the spirit realm lootable and then looting it in the spirit realm will make the skeleton in the normal realm lootable and so on. the next step is to find and lure the beast. in the spirit realm, the area immediately around the entrance to the cave the beast is patrolling in a circle. you may walk around the circle and wait and see the beast as it walks by. since you previously used familiars made fromgold,green, andcrimson charmsin thespirit of summerquest, the beast is ""familiar"" with any familiars made with them and so a new type of spirit is required. therefore, one must lure the beast using any blue charm familiar. it is possible to lure the beast with just one familiar; however, if you fail to lure the beast and it consumes your familiar, it is easier to have more (up to 5) pouches on hand. it is best to stay as near the cave entrance as possible while being close to the beast's ""patrol"" route. it may help if you position yourself so that you are closer to the mine entrance than your familiar, as it is you entering the mine that counts. position yourself by walking a bit further away from the mine with your familiar following you, and then walking a bit back towards the entrance. once the beast is focused onto the familiar or you, enter the mine. if the beast devours your familiar you must try again with another pouch. if the beast ignores your familiar it means that the beast was too far away. position the familiar closer to the beast's route for the next attempt. also, it's better to be too early than too late when entering the mine. it is necessary to run to avoid the beast's attacks. the beast makes long-ranged attacks, similar to a catapult attack. an attack is not instantaneous, but takes a short time to reach its target point. when launched, the attack targets where you are standing and does not track you if you move. when the attack hits the ground, it splashes into several secondary attacks, which hit you if you are still nearby. these attacks can hit into the 900s, and mid-500s are common. you can be hit by several of the splashes at once—being hit by all of them at once is nearly a guaranteed death. the key to survival and eventual victory is to avoid the beast's attacks. the earth shakes when the beast is unleashing its attack. you can thus avoid an attack by watching for this sign. also, the attack makes a ""whoosh"" sound while in flight, which can alert you if you missed the shaking. as the beast is weakened, it attacks faster, the attacks splash into more secondary attacks, and the splashes travel farther. you can run into any of the other rooms the beast is not in if you need to replenish your run energy or eat in peace. the beast can not attack you there. when the beast moves into a new room, you remain behind in the previous room. you can move on to the next room, but this is a good time to leave the cave and restock, if needed. run energy boosts such as the salt water spring inoo'glogafter completingas a first resortcan be very helpful as running is very helpful in avoiding the beast's attacks. thesurefooted aurasare useful here, as they recharge your energy fully whenever you come to a stop. remember that all the characters you meet during this quests are ghosts. except for one occasion, you must wear theghostspeak amuletto communicate with them. once you've lured the beast into the cave, a cutscene ensues.meranek thanatosexplains that he has discovered the beast has a weakness in its chest, where it stores the energy of the souls it devours. logs cut from the cursed willow roots in the room burn with exceptional brightness and the beast mistakes the fire for souls. meranek needs you to make the fire to distract the beast. when the beast is distracted, meranek strikes. you need to build 3 pyres, each pyre requiring 5 logs. your job is to cutcursed willow logsfrom the roots growing along the walls of the room and place them in any of the fire pits. the player has to right click to 'use' the logs on the fire pit; making this part of the quest very challenging. the beast attacks faster after each fire is lit. you can either build all the pyres, then light them all at once or light them one by one. a good tip here is to deposit 1 set of logs in the middle pit and then lure the beast behind it. you'll then be on a safe range to avoid attack from the beast while cutting the remaining logs. upon death, or leaving the cave pyres that were lit are remembered, but stacks of logs which were not lit will be lost. logs in your inventory will be kept. each pyre you light, meranek will attack the beast. it is possible to run using the minimap during the cutscenes of meranek's fights. if you do so, do not light the other fires while the cutscene is playing. fires lit while in cutscene will not count towards the 3 needed. if you exit the cave, you will appear outside the collapsed cave entrance in the real world (in the wilderness). one strategy is to go to the northern 3 roots in the picture and wait there. after your screen shakes run to the next root immediately and chop until the beast attacks again. this gives you quick access to logs and the fire pits. you will not be hit if done correctly and can save you a lot of necessary food. once you get the 15 needed logs, one strategy is to adjust your view so that you can see the fire pits. stand inside near the entrance of the cave and click ""use cursed log"" and run to the fire pit that you can see, then immediately run back to safety near the entrance of the cave. do this five times to get five logs in the pyre. then click on ""light pyre"" and after lighting, again, run back to the safe spot. in this way you can make the needed pyres without taking much damage at all. the beast can be safespotted as it has a limited attack range and can be trapped behind a fire pit. one location which is safe is the easternmost root, when the beast is trapped behind the center pyre. the strategy of using the south western most roots due to a ""safe spot"" is actually false, but there is a bug, when he gets ""stuck"" on the middle fire pit, and can't attack you if you run to the northernmost part of the cave. when you have built and lit 3 pyres, meranek will have attacked the beast three times. the beast moves into the second room, giving you an opportunity to restock and heal. theinferno adzeis not recommended because it will burn some of the logs, thus wasting time. also, your inferno adze will not be saved by the gravestone. if you leave the cave or die thecursed willow logscannot be banked. your player can still move during the cut scenes. you can light all of the pyres during the other pyres's cut scenes. as you enter the room, a cutscene plays.jallek lenkinknows how to damage the spirit beast more and needs your help. thedark coremust be lured out from inside the spirit beast and trapped in a hole. when the beast goes to retrieve its core from the hole, jallek attacks. he needs to attack it three times. run around avoiding attacks until the dark core comes out. the beast will stay relatively in the centre of the dirt mounds, so you can run around it repeatedly while it attacks you, staying on the trail of the mounds. the beast will stop attacking when it releases the core. you will also get a green message in your chatbox:the dark core has come out of the beast! when the core is out, use your spade next to a patch of the soft soil to dig a hole. the core will head toward you if it is close enough. otherwise, get nearer to it to get its attention. put the hole between yourself and it, and it will fall in. if you take too long, the hole will collapse and must be dug again. when successful, a cutscene of jallek's attack plays. failure means the beast will come up and retrieve the core. a ""checkpoint"" is created after each cutscene, so if you die, the game will remember how many times the cutscene has been played. one strategy here is to have the spade in your tool belt, and run continuously around the circle of soft soil patches by clicking on them to dig. as the holes collapse after only a short while, you don't have to worry about stopping short. when the dark core is released, most of the time it will jump straight into the last hole you dug. thesurefooted aurasare especially useful here, because each time you stop to dig, the aura will top up your run energy. if the core touches you, you will take a small amount of damage. although jallek warns you to avoid this, it is not necessary to bother. the damage pales in comparison to what you take from one of the beast's attacks. each time after jallek attacks, it takes longer for the dark core to come out, and the beast attacks faster, with more splashes, similar to the last room. when jallek has attacked the beast three times, it moves into the third room. you can eat and restock. if you run out of run energy, there is a safe spot near the entrance to the tunnel at the east where you can rest out of reach of the beast. in the final room, you will finally help destroy the beast. when you enter the room a cutscene plays, and the three spirits explain that this room has their graves. if the player blesses the graves at the right time, the spirits can hurt and destroy the beast. there are five graves in the room. each spirit will inhabit one grave at a time. each also has its own colour: red, yellow, blue (erik's soul is red, jallek's soul is yellow and meranek's soul is blue). once the cutscene ends, you will see each coloured spirit fly to a grave. the beast then starts attacking. for each attack, the beast charges with a colour the same as one of the three spirits. if you bless the grave containing the spirit with the same colour as the attack being charged, the attack when made will rebound against the beast. blessing a grave consumes prayer points, which may be replenished at the altar in the room. do this once for each of the three colours. after the beast attacks, the spirits may or may not change graves. the cursed nature of the ground in the cave means the spirits cannot stay in one grave long. a spirit can only cause the rebound once, so if you've already used the blue, you cannot use it again. the beast's attack hits the entire area in front of him, to avoid it, hide behind the beast. it may be easiest to keep track of only one or two colours, hiding behind the beast to avoid his attack when he charges up a colour you are not watching for. like the other rooms, each rebound becomes a ""checkpoint"" which the game will remember if you die or leave the area, however, you may wish to take note of which colours you've already rebounded. pay attention to your chat box , as it will show which attempts were successful and save major annoyance. once all three colours have rebounded an attack, the beast is destroyed. if you died and killed the beast at the same time, it will still count, just return to the third room to find summer and the other spirits. after the beast is destroyed, summer will appear and tell you that her energy is feeling more powerful already. she is still a ghost, but she will still talk to you even if you are not wearing the ghostspeak amulet. she tells you to speak to the elder spirits in the cave. equip the ghostspeak amulet (if you aren't wearing it), and speak to the spirits to hear their story. agree to leave the cave with them, and you will be transported out of it. speak to them again to obtain the rewards. congratulations, quest complete! after completing this quest, all thewildernessspiritual portals are opened. see thespirit realmarticle for more information onspiritual portals. it also makes available the wilderness crater teleport leading tocorporeal beastongames necklaces, regardless of whether or not the entrance is blocked on the spirit realm. you also gain access to therogue jewellery shop. summer's end is not currently required for any quests or miniquests."

she would do it herself, but her sick ox,babe, cannot be left alone. the order of the friends you visit does not matter, but with each witch there is a puzzle. head south todraynor villageand speak toaggie, in the western-most house, about enchanting the broom. she tells you that the enchantment needs to be done in a special place, infused with 'magical pizazz'. agree to teleport, and you'll be taken to a small clearing, with a sand pattern created at the heart of it. aggie informs you that a specific sand symbol contains hidden power which could be harnessed into the broomstick. the arrangement must be created by sweeping four lines to end up with four triangles. one of the two solutions is shown to the right. once you've completed the pattern, a surge of power will pass through the area and enchant maggie's broomstick. next, speak tobettyin hermagic shoplocated inport sarim, and tell her about maggie's broom. although she would be happy to enchant it, she requires her wand which is stored and locked up in the basement. nevertheless, she suggests talking to her assistant,lottie, for help in retrieving it. climb down into the shop basement and speak to lottie, who tells you that the wand is secure in the nearby chest and the key to unlock it is in the form of a puzzle - you need to put the menagerie in the southern chamber back into order. lottie will give you amagic slatethat will help you keep track of the animals' locations while you are moving them around. keep in mind that the animals can only be moved to a cage adjacent to their current one, and that you cannot have two animals in the same cage at the same time. the bat, snail and blackbird are already placed in their proper pens. after completing the puzzle, open the chest and search it to obtainbetty's wand(you may need to right click and search). go back upstairs and hand over the wand to betty, who proceeds to enchant thebroomstickfor you. for the final enchantment, travel torimmingtonand speak tohettyin her house located east of the town well. instead of enchanting the broom, hetty promises to concoct a 'theurgicalbroom ointment' that you directly apply on the broomstick. however, she needs a newt to complete it. hetty has recently received a new package of newts and toads, so she asks you to simply retrieve a newt from her basement. agree and go down the trapdoor south of her house. you'll meet up withgus, the delivery ghoul, who explains that the three delivery crates - containing newts, toads, and a combination of newts and toads - have got their labels mixed up somehow and being phobic to newts, he cannot dare to look in and check each of the crates. gus requests you to help him label the crates correctly, keeping in mind that all the crates are wrongly labelled and that you can only remove one sample from any one crate. he gives you three labels to apply on the correct crates:newt label,toad labelandnewts and toads label. the combination is different for every player. to solve the puzzle, you must remember that every crate is labelled wrong, and that you are only allowed to choose the sample from one crate. if you make a mistake, gus will let you know and you can start over. just keep trying the possible combinations from the table below until you get it right (sometimes it may glitch and he will only say ""don't touch the crates without my permission""). after you've successfully labelled all the crates correctly, take a newt out of the newt crate and head back to hetty. she'll apply some newt slime to the ointment and pass it back to you;

if you don't have enough inventory space, you can take more than one trip. go to the lake south of tai bwo wannai and net fish for 22 karambwanji (the extra 2 are for later). once you have them, return to lubufu. he'll take 20, and after speaking to him again and asking him how he catches the karambwan, he'll ask you if you want to become his apprentice. agree and he will give you akarambwan vessel. you can drop the vessel and tell him a shark ate it to get a second one, to save time later. use a karambwanji on this to bait it. it's not necessary to fish any karambwan at the time, and doing so will require you to obtain more karambwanji. now find the third son,tiadeche, who is located on the east island on the north shore, and can be reached most easily byfairy ringdkp. you need to use the baited vessel on tiadeche. he will keep the vessel, and tell you to give an identical vessel to tinsay to reverse engineer (after the spear is given). he will also offer youraw karambwanas a sign of gratitude for helping him. to the south is a camp ofjogres. kill one of them and collect thejogre bonesfor later. return to a bank to gather the remaining items, if needed. cook theraw karambwanon arange(there is one inbrimhaven). the logs are not for this step but rather a later step. the karambwan would turn into a light-greenpoison karambwan, or aburnt karambwan. if you burn it, you'll have to obtain more, either by fishing them yourself (65 fishing required) or buying them from players or on thegrand exchange. grind the poison karambwan to makekarambwan paste. use the karambwan paste on your spear to poison the tip, turning it into akarambwan poisoned spear(denoted by(kp)at the end of its name).  the karambwan poison paste can be applied to any other spear (steel or better, up to rune) if you don't have an iron one. return totamayuand use your karambwan poisoned spear and theagility potion(4) on him. talk to him again and ask him to bring you on his next attempt to hunt. a cutscene will then follow where he will successfully defeatthe shaikahanand agree to return to tai bwo wannai. ask tamayu to skin the monkey corpse you obtained earlier, granting you amonkey skin. if you aren't given the chat option to ask him to skin the monkey, you can use it on him for the same effect. the monkey skin can be used withseaweed(found near the shores around the cairn isle bridge, if you don't already have one) to create theseaweed sandwich. return tocairn isleand givetinsaythe sandwich. he will ask you to bring himmarinated jogre bones. at this point you can give thekarambwan vesseltotinsay. after a moment he will give you acrafting manual, which can be given totiadechein order to make him agree to return to the village. if you already have thejogre bonesand logs, instead of running all the way totiadecheand then back totinsay, you can complete the next section ""marinated jogre bones"" without leaving tinsay's area. if you don't already havejogre bones, fight ajogreon the way totiadeche, just east of the log shortcut over the river.jogrescan also be found in the caves north of tai bwo wannai village. while preparing this portion, be careful not to bury the bones. use the right-click option every time to be safe. right-click the jogre bones and select light to burn them intoburnt jogre bones. grind the last raw karambwanji (and make sure it's raw, the cooked version does not work) with your pestle and mortar to makekarambwanji pasteand add the paste to the burnt bones to getpasty jogre bones. cook the pasty jogre bones on a fire (there are 2 fires just south of the village, or you can use your own fire) to make them intomarinated jogre bones. return to tinsay and give him the bones. be careful not to bury the bones, as this is still the first click option instead of 'use'. after eating the marinated jogre bones, tinsay will agree to return to tai bwo wannai. bringtiadechethe crafting manual (gained from tinsay in return for the karambwan vessel) if you haven't yet. after you've convinced all three brothers to return, talk totimfrakuto finish the quest. regardless of your response to him, you'll get a 2,000 coin reward. congratulations, quest complete! the three brothers can be found in the three small huts along the southern wall of tai bwo wannai after the quest is completed. each of them will give the player additional quest rewards. tamayugives the following rewards when spoken to: tinsaygives the following rewards when spoken to: tiadechegives the following rewards when spoken to: tai bwo wannai trio is not currently required for any quests or miniquests. completing tai bwo wannai trio is also a requirement to complete thebarbarian smithingsection of thebarbarian trainingactivity."

it works somewhat like a compass - by default it faces north, sorotate the whiskers to move the arrow direction. when you see the cat's eyes light up, go in that direction to find bob. he can be anywhere inrunescapethat is not blocked by physical boundaries, essentially meaning that he can be anywhere within thefree-to-playarea and some of themembers' area. a good strategy for findingbob the catis to use triangulation. find the direction of bob fromhild's house, and then teleport somewhere far, likevarrockorrimmington. find which direction bob is from there, and by tracing the two directions from where they started to where they cross, you will have a pretty good idea where bob is. he appears as a yellow dot on your minimap. server updates lead to resetting bob's location to burthorpe. bob's common locations: after finding bob, talk to him. he tells you he left because he's smitten byneite, who refuses to interact with him because she doesn't know about his family. your cat suggests you talk togertrudeabout bob's family as she was the one who handed bob over to unferth. travel to varrock and talk togertrude. she says that she has no idea about bob's lineage, as she found him at her doorstep in a basket, although your cat tells you to ask her about a warrior calledrobert the strong. when she fails to remember the name, she directs you toreldo, in the library invarrockpalace. reldo says that robert the strong is a forgotten legend from the fourth age and was taller and stronger than any other man of his time. his longbow was six feet tall and he fought immortal monsters known as thedragonkin, alongside his sidekick,odysseus, a black panther. go back and speak with bob. after trying hard to help him remember his past, odysseus, the dragonkin, your cat reminds you of your adventures in the desert, when you were hypnotized by the devourer. it says that maybe thesphinxcan help bob access his lost memories in the same manner. talk to the sphinx insophanem. ask her for help, and after a bit, you'll have the option to view a 5 minute 20 second cutscene or get a brief summary of what happens. during the cutscene, thesphinxwill teleport bob tosophanemand hypnotize him. bob, thinking back on his earliest memories, recalls himself asrobert the strong. he sees himself looking over at a tower beside odysseus, followed by a battle between them anddragonkin;

the pedestal will develop an aura of orange light and the block of ice/snow slightly melts. a ""squeeze-past"" option becomes available from the ice block. this has no agility level requirement. scale up east damaged wall. climb down north-west smashed rampart. you find yourself in the upper level of the fortress dungeon. the area you want to reach is the south-west corner of this level. unfortunately, the direct path is blocked by ice, therefore you must melt some of it by using the heat globes you will find inside the fortress. after climbing the ladder, run west a few rooms to engage with the level 98ice demon. it attacks with both ranged and magic, but as its magic attacks hit harder,protect from magicis recommended over the range counterpart. the ice demon is completely immune to water magic. swiftly kill the ice demon to get thefrostenhornas a drop. if you die or teleport away after killing the ice demon but before retrieving the frostenhorn, it will appear outside the trapdoor leading underground. if the frostenhorn does not drop when killing the ice demon with ranged or magic attacks, switching to melee may fix the issue. if melee mode doesn't solve the problem, turning combat to legacy mode is an alternative solution. you cannot receive frostenhorn if you are in a group. return to azzanadra however you wish. teleporting to him viaali's pendant, thedig site pendant, or thearchaeology journalare suggested methods. azzanadra will be in thedigsite dungeonwhere you left him, but he will have finished restoring the altar, in quite an impressive fashion. he will tell you that you need to retrieve a last item from someone just outside, by the winch. go up the winch and just west of where you entered, you will find theassassinwho tricked you duringdevious minds(the assassin may instead be standing near the other winch to the south-west). talk to him and he will give you the item azzanadra wants – therelicyou unwittingly helped him steal fromentrana. pass on the relic to azzanadra downstairs. a cutscene plays, where azzanadra opens a communication portal and contactszaroshimself. as the connection between worlds is established, zaros's influence apparently returns to the world in a small way. this is seen in the cutscene as, throughout the world, strange things occur. talk to azzanadra again to complete the quest and receive your reward. azzanadra praying for zaros to return the dig site workmen receive some power. something's happening... a statue of zamorak is destroyed invoking the anger of zamorakian monks against saradomin the portal almost exploding the temple at senntisten is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

(just south-east of theranging guildand north-east of theardougne lodestone) climb down the ladder, to enter thetemple. head west along the main corridor until you arrive at a staircase. make sure your light source is lit, and go down the stairs. go to the small north-east area and try to slash thespider web- it may take a few tries. take theboots of lightnessfrom inside and equip them. go back up the stairs. return to the centre of the corridor, and enter the north gate. make sure you have lucien's pendant equipped, or ""a great terror will overcome you!"" and you will be pushed away from the gate. inside you will find level 58skeletons. run to the west until you come to a bridge, which you must now cross. if you run north instead and find yourself in a passage with a door you can't open, you have gone the wrong way. your total weight must be less than 0.0 kg or the bridge will give way and you will fall into the lava below. you will take up to 200 life points of damage before washing up near numerousscorpions. if this occurs, exit via the ladder to the south, go east to unload a few items at the bank chest and return to the temple. you may also use a beast of burden familiar to carry the items you need. across the bridge, enter the room and take theleverlying near the south wall. now cross the bridge again, heading back to the dungeon entrance next to the ladder you came down when you entered the area, and use the lever on the lever bracket found on the south-western diagonal wall. finally, pull the lever and the south gate will now be unlocked. if you are planning to go and bank some items, be sure to pull the lever first. if you leave the temple without doing this, you will not be able to re-enter without collecting a new lever. if you did go through the gate, upon return, it will appear that the lever in the bracket has gone but you will not need to obtain another lever as you can still enter through the south gate. the area leading from the south gate is filled with a number of level 42 monsters, and you may have to spend some time there, so it may be wise to return to the bank and obtain some armour and food. however, if you go to the bank, make sure to bring the pendant of lucien back with you.
once you are ready, enter the gate. the entire icy passage is lined with 6 smaller inlets, each containing a chest which may containice arrows. however, the area is crawling withice spiders(level 42) who do not show up on the mini-map, and may attack unremittingly while you are searching the chests. it will also be necessary to search the chests multiple times to obtain enough ice arrows; up to 14 arrows can be found in any one chest, but usually only a few chests will contain any arrows in one respawn period. the chests refresh every minute or so, so there is no need to hop worlds. if you are using abilities, you will only need two or three. more may be required without abilities. once you have a good number of arrows, return to the central corridor and enter the north gate. head north into an alcove where there is a lever on the north wall. right-click the lever to search for traps first, then pull it. if you pull the lever with less than 42thieving, or don't check for traps, you will fall into a spike pit and take 200 points of damage. successfully pulling the lever opens the gate into the guardian chamber, to the west. you have to enter the chamber quickly, or the lever and trap will reset. head to the north side of the chamber and try to open the door. afire warriorwill appear, and use afire blastto shove you away from the door, although deals no damage. he must be killed using the ice arrows before the door can be opened. with 40ranged, using abilities and ayew shortbow, lower levelled players may be able to defeat the fire warrior of lesarkus using as few as two arrows. you can pick up ice arrows on the ground. despite that he attacks with fire spells, he has melee range, which means you can easily safespot him across the skeletons in the room without ever being hit. once you have defeated him, you may pass into the next room. waiting for too long will cause him to tell you to come back when you are stronger. however, you can continue fighting him and he will not have recovered to full health. after passing through the door, talk towinelda, who will request 20 unnoted limpwurt roots in exchange for transporting you across the lava in your path. if you already have the limpwurt roots in your inventory, she will take them automatically saying you're well prepared. otherwise, give her the roots, and after a short cutscene you will be teleported across. run to the end of the passage, past the large room, the skeletons andlesser demons, until you reach a safe area where you will find ashiny key. take the key and then head north-east and enter the compound of theguardians of armadyl. if you die while obtaining the staff or by the lesser demons, you can get across the lava again without paying the limpwurt roots, and the fire guardian does not have to be killed a second time. now you must decide if you want to side with lucien or with the guardians of armadyl. currently, the only difference this causes is that by siding with the guardians you will receive acommuniquéfrom them at some point and you can get thependant of armadyleasily (by asking the guardians without killing them). remove thependant of lucienand talk to one of the guardians. they will be impressed that you have travelled so deep into the temple. wearing it will make the guardian you are talking to be aggressive towards you, so if this happens, trap it, take it off and talk to another guardian. state that you are looking for the staff of armadyl and that lucien will reward you for it. disappointed, they will say that evil is lurking around you and gives you an option to be splashed with holy water; say that it is time for your yearly bath. the guardian will cleanse you of lucien's influence and warn you that he is amahjarrat, who must not get the staff, lest he become too powerful. they will then give you thearmadyl pendantso that you can attack and defeat him. you may now either teleport out, or go back into the passageway, head east, and go up the ladder. you will find yourself in a shed outsidemcgrubor's wood; use the shiny key to exit the shed. there is a fairy ring in mcgrubor's woods - just head west of the shed and slip through the loose railing. after teleporting toedgeville, make your way to the building across theriver lum, just outside thegrand exchangewestern wall and south of thefairy ringdkr. you can also use edgeville home teleport and run north-east across the bridge, then south. equip the pendant of armadyl and enter the house there. now attack lucien; he has only 1 life point. lucien will state that he doesn't have time for this, and that he will get someone else to do his bidding. congratulations, quest complete! go to the north-west corner of the compound, and enter the small room. the staff is located on a table in the southern part of the room. when you attempt to take the staff, the guardians might catch you and attempt to stop you. kill them if needed until you obtain the staff. once you have the staff, you may either teleport out or go back into the passageway, head east, and go up the ladder. you will find yourself in a shed outsidemcgrubor's wood. use the shiny key to exit the shed. after teleporting to edgeville, make your way to the building across theriver lum, just outside thegrand exchangewestern wall and south of thefairy ringdkr. you can also use edgeville home teleport and run north-east across the bridge, then south. enter the house and deliver the staff to lucien. congratulations, quest complete!

(choose this first for all the miners). next, choose ""tzhaar who gets assaulted in its home is tzhaar-hur."" then talk totzhaar-mej-kol(directly north of tzhaar-hur-klag) and choose the option ""one is a tzhaar-mej who is aware of the situation."" talk totzhaar-xil-mor(south-east) and choose the only option ""that they are to be the criminal"". then return totzhaar-hur-brektand choose ""we should decide an ending"" then ""the criminal's plans are foiled."" go totzhaar-xil-morand choose ""how can i make the story better?"", then ""the plans aren't always foiled."" talk to tzhaar-hur-brekt and tell him that ""they are all happy with the plot."" talk totzhaar-ket-lurkto find out the personality traits of the miners, which this step is optional. tzhaar-ket-jokgets the role of jalyt jenny. ask if he is happy with the role and slightly modify the role so that he is not a jalyt. saynoto his second request of being victorious against the tzhaar-xil. tzhaar-xil-morgets the role of toktz-ket-ek-mack. his role needs no modification to make him pleased with his part. tzhaar-hur-klaggets the role of tzhaar-hur. sayyesto his request for modification of the role. tzhaar-mej-kolgets the role of ketkul-schmul. then click modify after he gets upset. finally speak totzhaar-hur-brekt, tell him that all the roles have been assigned, and he will tell you how to mine magma. go back to the obsidian mine. simply click on one of the striped areas of wall to the east oftzhaar-hur-brektto obtain a piece ofstone slab. gather 17 stone slabs, it is recommended to have 3 extra in case you make a mistake. craft the stone slabs into some stonepillars; they reward 20 crafting experience each. spam clicking the last stone slab in your backpack will result in nearly all of them being crafted at the same time. you will need the pillars you've created to repair the tunnels. go back to the bank to gear up for the next part of the quest. this includes combat gear including the proper runes to deal with several enemies (water spells are effective) and a ranged weapon. you can use prayers. bank some pillars so you can take the 14 oak planks. after fixing a few tunnels, you may restock. you cannot use abeast of burdento carry the pillars or thetreated oak planks. you will have an opportunity to visit a bank before fighting the toktz-ket-dill, so unless your combat levels are low, you do not need to bring any food. now go talk totzhaar-hur-frok, one of the three mine guards north oftzhaar-ket-grolwhere the quest started, and ask if he can turn youroak planksintotreated oak planks. go back to tzhaar-ket-grol, then enter the crack in the wall to the south. players enter a maze of connected tunnels which have been damaged bytoktz-ket-dill. to get to the next tunnel, all damaged areas in that particular tunnel need to be fixed. if you get a warning to ""prepare the tok-ket"", it's because you haven't crafted the stone slabs into pillars. this can be done inside. some sections of the walls have caved-in (shown as red corridor sections on the minimap) and some sections of the ceiling have caved-in (shown as piles of rubble, as well as pale brown shapes on the minimap). if players try to mine into the next tunnel before stabilising all the cave-ins in the current one, they fail and take 80 to 600+ life points damage. a player may quit the tunnels at any time (e.g., to restock supplies) without losing progress by returning to the dungeon entrance. to repair both kinds of damage, first examine them. if the damage to a wall is very bad, or to a ceiling is bad or very bad, use stone pillars. otherwise, use treated oak planks. if the wrong kind of material is used, the repair collapses, damaging players 40 to 130 life points. players can safely walk past or jump over cave-ins before they are repaired. after placing a stone pillar, players cannot pass through it. players should survey each tunnel and plan what goes where before unwittingly trapping themselves behind a pillar or blocking off something else they need to repair. if players need to pass a pillar, they must collapse the pillar, destroying it permanently. in this case, you may teleport out and return to the tunnels to continue. players can safely walk past the oak planks once in position. the first tunnel requires 6 planks and 4 pillars to repair. the second tunnel requires 6 planks and 6 pillars to repair.
the third tunnel requires 2 planks and 7 pillars to repair. if you have trouble placing a pillar in a wall (e.g. you keep stepping in front of the wall and cannot place the pillar), rotate the camera view and try again. it may take several rotations until it works. you may also want to try standing just at the edge of the rubble; this prevents your character from needing to run to the cave-in. the second and third tunnels containsfire monstersandlava monsters. both types of monsters stay behind a lava stream and are level 53. players cannot cross the lava streams with a monster waiting on the other side. thering of recoilis useless against these creatures. fire monsters attack with magic and must be fought with magic.protect from magicprotects from the fire monster's attack. lava monsters attack with magical ranged and must be fought with ranged.protect from missilesprotects from the lava monster's attack. the second tunnel contains a fire monster. the third tunnel contains a fire monster and two lava monsters. one of the lava monsters is hiding behind a rock. players must kill it from a dead-end side tunnel. darts and knives do not reach far enough to kill it, so a crossbow or bow are required. the other two monsters attack players simultaneously, one with magic and one with ranged. bring an adamant pickaxe or better to break the shell. players must equip the pickaxe or a melee weapon (if using the toolbelt) for the first phase of this fight. hybrid armour works as well. in the next tunnel are the trappedtzhaar-hurs. right-click and talk to them. ask them if they've seen thetoktz-ket-dill. they say it has a small home in a tunnel to the north. clear the rubble to the south to open the main access tunnel to the mine. go to the bank, get some melee-resistant armour and a suitable weapon for the fight with level 100 toktz-ket-dill (weak to water spells but also easily killed with melee), and return. you will no longer be able to access the crack in the wall to access the mines, and will now have to use the main access tunnel. enter the tunnel to the north to begin the battle against the toktz-ket-dill. if you die, yourgravestonewill appear in the chamber with the trapped tzhaar-hurs, outside the tunnel to the toktz-ket-dill. you can reach it by entering the tunnel guarded by tzhaar-xil-tog and the two others. the toktz-ket-dill can slam its tail on the ground and cause the ceiling to fall onto players for 1000+ damage. if the player does not wear full melee armour, the player will not break through its shell, but it will continue to slam its tail on the ground, potentially killing the player very quickly. the attack deals typeless damage, meaning protection prayers have no effect on it. although the monster can do it at any time, it appears to do it much more frequently if players are using prayer before the shell is broken. players should not use prayer before breaking the shell. players should use protect from melee after breaking the shell. the fight is fairly unique, since the toktz-ket-dill has very thick armour that can only be broken with a pickaxe. players must keep hitting it with their pickaxe until its armour breaks, similar to thebulwark beastfromdungeoneering. melee abilitiesdocount towards breaking the monster's armour. players hit 0 while they are breaking through the toktz-ket-dill's armour, but they will receive messages in the chatbox indicating their progress. if directly attacking the monster with a pickaxe, an off-hand weapon can be used alongside it. it is highly recommended to bring one as this allows access to dual-wield melee abilities. damage-over-time abilities, such asdismember, are highly useful as they can quickly break through the monster's armour due to their multiple hits. breaking the armour is the hardest part. once it is broken, the fight is fairly easy. when the toktz-ket-dill's shell is broken, use any melee weapon to finish it off. it uses slow, but strong, ranged and melee attacks, and can hit over 1000, even if you're using high-level armour such as dragon. the toktz-ket-dill rarely uses ranged attacks, but they are much more accurate than the melee attacks. after killing the toktz-ket-dill, it drops 1,000tokkulandbig bones. head south out of the mine, and talk to any of the three tzhaar to finish the quest. congratulations, quest complete! toktz-ket-dill is not currently required for any quests or miniquests."

this quest, so it is a good idea to leave enough room in your backpack for all weapons and armour, as well as additional quest items. if you make a mistake at certain parts in the quest, you will be

one before she disappeared). to enter the camp, talk to themercenary captainnear the gate. you can talk to his mercenaries and bribe them with 5 coins so they will tell you a bit about the location and give you hints on how to goad him into fighting you alone instead of getting his guards to deal with you, but this is not required. compliment the captain and agree to do him favours, but when he asks you to killal zaba bhasim, say that you do not think you can do that, and then insult him for not fighting his own battles. this will start a fight and you must kill him (aring of recoilkill will suffice). your character should automatically pick up themetal key, thus granting you access to the camp. before you enter, make sure to unequip any armour. this includes shields, amulets, rings, and weapons. once you have entered, do not reequip them or you will be caught and thrown in jail. if you are put in jail, you can bend the cell wall window and climb out. go into the building to the north and search the table with a bowl on it. you will receive a main gate key (if you lost yours before) and acell door key, which will save you time if you get caught in the upcoming sections; simply use the cell key on the jail door if this happens. head a little further north-east into the camp and try to enter the gates that lead to the inner mine, but it is currently inaccessible as you do not look like a slave (you may have to right-click on the mine gate and select ""watch""). then, talk to one of the male slaves near the doors and he will tell you that he is planning on making an escape and can do with your help. agree to remove his handcuffs – you may get caught doing this and thrown in jail. alockpickmakes this part easy, but it is not necessary. keep trying, and once his handcuffs are off, he will offer to switch hisslave robesfor yourdesert robe(keep in mind that only the white desert robe works, not the brown one). while wearing the slave robes, go through the gates. upon entering, walk north and follow the cave around until you come to a guarded cave entrance (even if you kill all the guards, you'll still be unable to enter). talk to one of the guards standing there, and tell him that you'd like to mine in a different area. he will barter you access to the area for a pineapple, specifically atenti pineapple, so do not bother bringing a regular one. exit the mine and head west to thebedabin camp. al shabim can be found in the southern large tent, wielding astaff of air. when you talk to him about the pineapple, he agrees to give it to you, though only if you get theplansto a new weapon hidden in a chest back at the mining camp. agree and he will give you abedabin key. with all your armour and trinkets unequipped, head back east to the mining camp and

select ""i wanted to have a chat?"". mention that he has a lot of books, then direct the conversation towards sailing (if you have found the sailing books on his bookshelf). choose the option ""i could tell by the cut of your jib"" when presented. he will then drift off into his sailing stories. while he is distracted, open the chest to get the plans. faster alternatives include telling him that the slaves escaped or select ""fire! fire!"". he will get distracted and you can get the plans from the chest without siad noticing, but they only work once before he wises up and throws you in jail, which resets the conversation and you can try again. head back west to thebedabin campand showal shabimthe plans. if you have the feathers and bronze bars in your inventory, he will give you permission to usean experimental anvilin the tent to the north. use thebronze barson the anvil to create someprototype dart tips. then add thefeathersto make aprototype dart. it is possible to fail when smithing the dart tips or attaching the feathers, losing some in the process, so spares may be required. if you forgot the bar or feathers, you can swim over to tuska's corpse just west of the camp to bank. you may fail and lose your bronze bar, so bringing multiple may be beneficial. if you see the notice saying you failed, just don't click continue and then use the bronze bar on the anvil again. take this back to al shabim and he will give you somebronze darts, along with the tenti pineapple. before re-entering the mining camp, take off your equipment and put on theslave robes. head back down the mine and hand over the pineapple to the guard. he will now let you inside the mine cave. walk east into the mine until you find yourself in front of a mine cart. right-click 'search barrel' on an emptybarrel(be sure you take the barrel with you). then right-click ""search"" the mine cart to ride it to the other side. you can fail and bang your head or knee on the cart and take anywhere from 35 to 485 damage. if you get thrown into jail before riding the cart, go back and ride the cart. otherwise you won't be able to put ana in your barrel later. once there, you will see four paths. go down the second one from the left containing a large number of slaves at the end and you will findanain its north-eastern corner. talk to her and tell her that you are here to help her go back to her mother. if you tell ana that the guards are rubbish, you may be thrown into an isolated area where you will need to mine 15 punishment rocks in order to escape, or alternatively you can teleport out and travel back. ask her if she knows a way to escape out of the mine, to which she says that the only thing that goes out of the mine are the barrels of rocks that they mine. when you suggest to hide ana in a barrel to sneak her out of the mine, she will refuse. use the barrel in your inventory on ana tohide her in it, and head back to the mine cart. if you drop her any time during the quest before escaping, a guard will notice and you will be thrown into jail and will have to rescue her again. put the barrel with ana into the mine cart which you came from, and send it down the track before getting in yourself and riding down to the other side. again, search the barrels around the cart until you find ana in one of them. don't walk straight out of that area of the mine holding ana in your barrel. a guard will compliment you on the heaviness of your barrel, ana would retort indignantly about her weight and then he will kick your barrel open, revealing ana and you will have to rescue her again. walk north-west to the winch bucket and use the barrel with ana on it. the guard nearby will help you hoist it up onto the platform. to set ana on the winch bucket, you have to use the barrel on the winch. then the guard will ask if you need any help loading the barrel, select yes, and then ana will start to complain. when prompted select the speech saying that he was ""very gregarious."" once ana has been sent up through the winch bucket, head back to the surface and go to the winch bucket, in the south-west corner of the mining camp. operate the winch and search the barrel adjacent to it to retrieve ana. do not try to walk out the front gate! you now need to find a way to help ana escape the mining camp. talk to the cart driver near the wooden cart in the heart of the camp – he will not talk to you. place the barrel with ana into the back of the cart and try again. in order to get out, tell themine cart driverthe following phrases: search the cart after you have finished all of the dialogue to climb into it, then select the""yes, i'll get on.""option to escape out of the camp with ana. after you get out of the camp, head back toirena. she will

once the machine starts working, collect the remaining items from the crates at theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us]. finally, climb up to the top floor of the tower, where you will find an unfinished cage. build the cage using the items, and a puzzle will appear. clicking the horizontal or vertical button will make a bar appear. the bars can be changed in size by using the '+' and '-' sign. the bars initially start off at size one. click ""place bar"" to fit the bar at the broken areas. that side of the cage is now complete. now click the right arrow on the cage to turn the cage. as a precaution, an attempt to place another bar will give you the message ""this side is complete"" to let you know you are finished with that side. that side of the cage is now complete. turn the cage using the right arrow. that side is complete; turn the cage. now that the cage is complete, the puzzle screen should disappear. once all the three machines are properly fixed, you must go back to the ground level and talk to effigy. he will be delighted that you've finished the tower and disappear to the top of the tower, along with the other alchemists. you decide to join them. go back up to the top, where a long cut scene plays, in which ahomunculusis brought to life. to your player's surprise, the three alchemists mistreat the creature. they run away in fear when it proves able to cast a powerful magic spell. go back to the base of the tower and talk to effigy. unsurprisingly, he wants you to go back and confront the monster and hopefully calm it down, so that they can carry on with their experiment. once again, return back up top. you now need to push the homunculus' mind towards magic or logic. all multiple-choice answers are either magical, logical or neither. you need to push the bar at the top of the screen either to fully magical or fully logical. it does not matter if you push the homunculus's mind towards magic or logic, the outcome will be the same. once committed to a certain belief, the homunculus will feel okay. there are 14 questions. choosing a 'magical' answer moves the arrow to the left, a 'logical' answer moves the arrow to the right, and a 'neither' answer stays put the progress. if you do not move the arrow all the way to one end, then the questions repeat. likewise, you could finish before all the questions are asked. one last time, return to the outside and speak with effigy. the homunculus will appear and scare off the alchemists and will want to speak with you again and tell you to meet him in the basement of the tower. you can get in there by using the trapdoor on the south wall. go into the dungeon and talk to the homunculus once more to complete the quest. he is located north of the ladder by the experiments table. tower of life is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

the same multi-personality symptoms displayed byerasinus. senecianus entered the asylum in search of cure, but intentionally avoided the otherdemonsbecause he believes abyssals are disgusting, corpse-dwelling barbarians. you will explain that other demons are suffering from similar problems inthe abyss. after further discussion, you explain gregorovic has the exact same condition as him and that you're currently in search of a cure. shocked by the unlikely coincidence, senecianus enthusiastically shares his notes:naborwrote a full description of the condition and lefthis noteson a desk nearby, although senecianus did not find them useful. finally, senecianus gives the player a copy of thebreak curse scrollused to treat him before. senecianus believes that the cure will be discovered using a combination of the scroll and nabor's work. make sure to get the copy of the scroll before leaving. you may obtain avialfrom acrate of vialsin a small room northeast of senecianus. fill a vial up by thesinkby going furthest south in the asylum and then walking into the western room to get avial of vile water. use asyringeon senecianus or gregorovic to get asample of blood. use theinfernal asheson the vial of vile water to create a vial ofexperimental potion #6, and then use the syringe of chthonian blood onto it to create thesipd cure. be sure to ""use"" the ashes as opposed to default option ""scatter"". there are no more ashes could be obtained from the spiky chair. players may pick up a copy of the diagnostic sanitarium manual from the desk south-east of senecianus, if they wish. this is not required to complete the quest. in the room south-west of where the syringe was found, thenabor's journalcan be obtained by searching his body. in the same room there is ashelf of potions, adesk, andshelves. all of these can be searched to find further information about the cure, but this is not required to complete the quest. talk to any of the aughra to hand over the cure. a brief discussion will take place, and the player tests the cure on gregorovic and senecianus. the player can choose to comfort gregorovic or insult him while administering the cure. after administering the cure, the demons return to their true forms. you will give a copy of the potion to the aughra, who informs you thatdagon the gatekeeper, who you had freed from theinfernal source dig site, infiltratedinfernusand discovered that many demons were leaving the planet for an unknown destination, which you believe to begielinor. the aughra will then leave. erasinus will be overjoyed at returning to his true form, although horrified by the memories he had as gregorovic. after some further discussion, both erasinus and senecianus suspect that sliske had transferred part of his essence into their soul, creating a magical resonance that could have been felt by their followers. naressa decides to return to orthen, while erasinus and senecianus go to meet withveilinius, as they can't enterfaladorin their normal forms. speak withsaradominin the throne room on the2ndfloor[uk]3rdfloor[us]of thewhite knights' castle. assisted by his daughteradrasteia, he is attending to the needs of his mortal followers. adrasteia is actively working to help saradomin regulate his temper after the events ofextinction. the cutscene opens withduke horaciooflumbridgerequesting assistance, as lumbridge has struggled financially for over 10 years; thebattle of lumbridgehas left the lumbridge duchy in debt alongside failing crops from the taint ofshadow anima. after some thought, saradomin will apologise to horacio, taking accountability for his actions at the battle of lumbridge and will agree to give lumbridge the generous compensation of one million gold. you inform saradomin of the suspected zamorakian plot. adrasteia will inform the world guardian that white knight patrols have reportedred-robe wearing cultistsnear theinfernal source dig site. believing it cannot be coincidence, saradomin will humbly request that you investigate by heading to thejolly boar innand speak with his knights there. make your way tojolly boar inn(north-east ofvarrockand south-west offort forinthry) by eitherfort forinthry lodestoneor teleportation toinfernal source dig site, and talk to thewhite knightsthere. when you have spoken to all four white knights, head to thedungeon of disorder. continuing twilight of the gods, descend the lift. once in thestar lodge cellar, speak withblythe, a young lady who's conflicted about joining the cult, as she feels she isn't ready for their standards. she will test you by asking you various questions: after answering the questions successfully, she will hand you a three-piece cultist robe set, including ahood, atop, and abottom. put on the robes and climb down thesecret passageto the north, where you will be welcomed byvala. head north and pickpocket any of the cultists with the pickpocket option until you receive acast iron key. speak to the following cultists to collect five pieces of information. first four pieces are collected fromwilona(join the ritual and repeat what wilona says),audrey,ridley, andedda. the last piece of intelligence is from a prisoner namedtyne, who's being held captive in the cells; he needs an outfit to escape. with the key you pickpocketed earlier, head to the lodging room in the southeast and open the southerncrateto collectspare cultist robes. if you happen to destroy the spare cultist robes, you can pickpocket the cultists until you receive another cast iron key to retrieve the robes again. return to the prisoner, who will ""agree"" to join the cult, thanking you for your assistance as he escapes. once all five pieces of information are obtained, return tofalador. you can search the bookshelf in the south central room and read the note for 500archaeologyexperience if you previously did not obtain one. return tofaladorto witnesssaradominarguing withgarlandia, who had been invited byadrasteiato make amends. the discussion goes nowhere regarding their matter, so upon noticing your return, saradomin requests that you report your findings. just as you warn him of the demons being teleported through the infernal source, thewhite knightsarrive and inform the group that demons are teleporting intogielinorand causing havoc. a cutscene will ensue wherebilrachteleports in and demands saradomin to surrender tozamorakin order to spare his people or die, as the god of chaos not only has regrown the wings he lost tozarosinchildren of mahbut also has summoned ""an impregnable shield"" to prevent anyone from stopping him. after bilrach takes his leave, discuss your options with saradomin until all options are depleted. while the optimal way to end the invasion would be to fight zamorak directly, the people of gielinor would be defenseless from the attacking demons; at the same time, even if saradomin and the remaining gods were to fight off the demons, zamorak would simply summon more, with or without the infernal source. however, while thinking of garlandia's earlier argument with saradomin, your voices believe that there may be a way to reestablish theedicts of guthix, to which saradomin agrees. go and talk toadrasteiawho can be found in the makeshift library on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]of thewhite knights' castle. she will reveal that theguardians of guthixare meeting at thetree of balanceand advises you go there. it may be the case that adrasteia is unable to be found in the library. if this is the case, simply exit to the lobby and rejoin the game for her to appear as intended. head to thetree of balanceby using thevarrock lodestoneorarchaeology journalteleport and running south of thearchaeology guild. talk to the tree. death,fiara,juna,ocellus, andvallutawill show up, stating they have been attempting to contact you but were unable to. there will be a conversation, and they will test your ability to carry theedicts. you will survive and prove that you can. they will then instruct you to report back tosaradominwhat has occurred. after speaking tosaradominabout the plan, he will give you anenergy scannerto look for a suitable place to start a simulation of the edicts. the first location will direct to thememorial to guthix, wherethe archivistwill be waiting outside the pool on the surface. it tells you that there isn't enough energy for the ritual. the scanner will then direct to thegleaming wispcolony north-east of the entrance to thenature altar. after a chat pop-up, a greenmystical wispshould be there; interact with it to be taken into a special instance of aguthixian cache. talk to theconfused automatoninside, who will state that attempting the ritual in the cache will result in you dying a gruesome death due to the area not being stable enough. the scanner will finally redirect tothe lost grove(fairy ring codebjsif repaired, and then interact with the magical mushrooms; otherwise walk west from theincandescent wispcolony, fairy ring codebkp, inspect the standstone, and continue walking north). talk tomerethiel, who will tell you that the grove is safe from the recent demonic incursions due tosolak's presence. you will tell her of the recent events, who tells you that the grove has everything suitable for the ritual attempt and allows you to use it. inside, theguardianswill arrive.junawill explain thatocellushas a contact, the black knightisaura, who has some items needed to start the ritual. head to isaura at theblack knights' baseintaverley dungeon(found just east of the entrance to the black knight area, near some weapon racks) and acquire acrate of birds, containing somezamorak hawksandsaradomin owls. return tothe lost groveand talk to juna, who will explain how to perform the ritual. grab thestone circle building kitfrom thematerial carteast of her. you need to collect four stone circle building kits. place one in eachstone circlestarting from west, then return to the cart. right-click the cart and select ""return"" and this will allow you to obtain the fourth building kit for the words below. anenergy springwill appear; harvest it to acquireguthixian energyto weave runes to create the ritual. each rune requires two energies to create. click on theoffering cradleto weave these energies into runes. you will have to do this multiple times, spelling the words below. the order of the words may vary. spell them from west to east, each time offering an effigy in the centre and carrying out the ritual. you must place one rune into each stone circle to spell out a word. then go to the centre and click to start ritual once you have a word spelled out. after the ritual the word will appear in your chat box to let you know if you are correct or whether you need to correct the letters. the puzzle works in a similar fashion to the gamewordle. if the letters are grey, no letters are used in that word. if they are yellow (purple in colourblind mode), it means that word has that letter but it's currently positioned in the incorrect place. if the letters are green (red in colourblind mode), it means that letter is in the correct spot. the order of the words needed is randomised, but will always correspond to the ritual (i.e. ward, halt and gods will always be required for ritual 1, and so on). after the first set of words, you will exclaim how powerful the ritual is and that it can banish the strongest of the gods. juna will then tell you to add a fifth rune into the ritual. after completing this, you'll realise that your inexperience with it will result in none or all of the gods being banished - you can't pick which ones can stay and leave. juna will then test the full capabilities of the grove and add a sixth word. upon completing this, you'll surge uncontrollably, remarking that you can't control the ritual at all likeguthixdid and that you'll lose your world guardian powers should you go with it, but you agree to give it up due to the more pressing threat ofzamorak. juna advises you to return tosaradominto tell him of the news. return tofaladorand talk toadrasteiawhere you normally findsaradomin, then saradomin will appear. you tell saradomin what would happen if you proceed with the ritual; while surprised, he agrees to it nonetheless to protect his people fromzamorak. while their followers and demi-gods would be unaffected, saradomin is confident that there would be those to stand up to evil. he will then tell you to meet with him at theempyrean citadelto discuss it with the other gods. adrasteia will offer a quick-teleport to the area, where the gods saradomin,armadyl,azzanadra, andicthlarinare assembled, the last three wondering why they were called for. you will tell them of your plan and that they would be banished fromgielinorif the ritual goes through without a hitch. armadyl is willing to leave, seeing how his kind only causes destruction and that mortals should live on their own terms. saradomin and azzanadra will agree mostly in part due to their own grievances against zamorak, while icthlarin won't be affected as he's just a demi-god. however, the ritual has to be conducted at thesword of edictsat thewilderness crater, which is shielded by zamorak and protected by his followers. saradomin promises to find a way through inside. as the gods leave, icthlarin asks you if you're able to do it, which you reply nervously to before he leaves. the initial quest complete screen is blank, showing only three dots. just click continue to be offered the last bit of dialogue betweenlight voiceandshadow voice, who break the fourth wall as they exit the quest complete screen, then discuss how cramped it was in there as they enter a normal chat box. they lament that their time will end after giving up your world guardian powers before they reveal that they are the faces of guthix's world guardian enchantment and resemblesliskedue to the adventurer absorbing both light anima from guthix and shadow anima from sliske, although they cannot answer why neither resembles guthix. finally, they promise not to interrupt the showdown with zamorak before declaring the quest complete. the damage reduction affects damage dealt by zamorak directly, but not damage dealt by mechanics such as the black sludge in the rune of destruction attack. twilight of the gods is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: o saradomin, unholy despot. i bring a message from zamorak, lord of chaos, imperator of gielinor, dictator of infernus and the lower planes, et cetera. the empire of chaos has returned. this world is ours. your armies are spent, o saradomin, while our demons outnumber the stars. you sit in crumbling fortresses while our forces attack at their leisure. your people are starving, while we burn your crops as offerings. even now, all-powerful zamorak summons legions to this world from behind an impregnable shield. supplicate yourself before him and he will spare the lives of your few misguided followers. refuse, and his wrath shall consume all lands."

lathasofardougneto help him destroy his corrupted brother,tyras. the quest continues the story fromspirit of the pass. this quest relies heavily on youragilityskill, often making you complete a number of obstacles in succession. in most cases, failing any of the obstacles in an area will send you back to the beginning of the area, which can be quite frustrating, especially if your agility is low. many of the obstacles are harder to traverse if the player has a high equipment load. as the risk of all enemies besides the final encounter may be mitigated via safe-spotting orprotect from melee, players should strike a balance between equippingweight-reducing clothingand protective armour. many of the traps in the dungeon damage you based on yourcurrenthealth. this means that by keeping your health relatively low, you will have to use lessfoodthrough the dungeon than you would if you were to eat to fulllife pointseach time you get damaged. it is advised not to have any pet or follower with you during the quest, as a certain section of the quest causes your character to freeze; if this happens, the only way out is teleporting, forcing you to start the pass over from the beginning. you can purchase arrows and ropes fromwest ardougne general store. to begin, talk toking lathason the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]of theardougne castle. after theprevious quest's revelation, you find out thatking tyras, lathas' brother, has moved on west, leaving his reign onwest ardougne. ask king lathas if his scouts have found a way through the mountains. he tells you that they have indeed uncovered an ancient tunnel, though it is riddled with cultists, who answer to the name of an evillord iban, the alleged son ofzamorak. he'll ask you to check in withkoftik, his tracker, who is waiting for you just outside the entrance to the tunnels in west ardougne. as the ruse about the plague is now known to you,west ardougnecan be accessed through the front gates, so head through and walk all the way west through the city until you find thecave entrancewith koftik standing outside. talk to him and he'll explain more about the pass and tell you to meet him inside, next to the bridge. enter the dungeon and you'll see three paths branching off in different directions. do not try to take the middle path as the unstable ground can potentially drag you down and send you tumbling down a very painful hillside, dealing around 140 damage, that you'll have to climb back up again. instead, take either of the other paths. climb over therockslidesto go around theswampand get to where koftik is standing next to a fire. there is astone tabletnear the beginning. it contains an eerie text that you may read if you wish. several more tablets will be encountered later on, written to celebrate iban and his supposed heritage. talk to him and he'll tell you it looks like there have been others in the cave already. he tells you that he found adamp clothalong with a book,the diary of randas. use the damp cloth on an arrow to make unlitfire arrow. then light the unlit fire arrow, or use the arrow on thefirenearby to get a lit fire arrow. it's recommended to use cheaper arrows, as their type makes no difference and it cannot be recovered. equip the bow and fire arrow. move into the small room to your north. look across the chasm and you can see where theguide ropeholds up thebridge. fire your lit arrow at the rope. if you try to shoot the arrow on the bridge guide rope from where koftik is, you will get a message saying you can't get a clear shot. if you succeed, the bridge will drop and you'll automatically walk across it. do not pull thelevernext to the wall past the bridge unless you want to leave. it will drop the bridge and send you back. moving on will take another arrow. if you did not bring aplankwith you, take the one nearby before proceeding. it can be used to safely pass some of the traps later. walk south a little to where you should see another fork in the path. do not go south into the swampy area with theblessed spiders, or you'll be sucked down. instead, walk east to a gap. stone tablets are spread throughout the cavern, inscribed with a passage that gives you a clue on how to proceed further safely. some work and pray, but only those who embrace the end and when all hope begins to fade use a rope with theold spikeon your side of the gap to create a rope balance that you can walk across. you may need to hover at the tip of the spike as its hitbox is so small. it is just a space adjacent to the northern edge. if you fail, you'll fall into a ramp and have to climb up, then start again from the very beginning of the pass. to get out of the ramp, look for rockslides you can climb over. the first one is to the south, the second to the north, the third between the south-western pair of roof supporting pillars, and the fourth south of the north western most roof supporting pillar. at the northwest corner of the ramp, you'll be able to climbpile of rocksback to entrance area. when you succeed, continue on the path over some more rockslides until you see koftik standing in front of a grid of tiles. when you talk to him, you realise that he is hearing voices, slowly going out of his mind. you'll now have to use trial and error to figure out which squares will drop you into a pit and the ones that will support you. it's different for every person, so you'll have to figure it out for yourself. not all grid paths are possible, you will never need to: if you stand on any square for too long, you will fall. falling down on the pit will cause you to take 150 damage. once you get across the grid, there is an altar in the next important room, so you can userapid healto save some food. there areprotruding rockssurrounding the small spike pit; climb them to get back up. should you die from falling, your gravestone will stay in the pit. to retrieve what you lost from the gravestone then, you must intentionally step on a square that will drop you into the pit. make sure to remember what the path is, since you'll need to come back this way again when you want to doregicide. this path will always be the same from now on, so record the correct sequence or you will take heavy damage in the future. you can use the table below to save your path: click a cell to highlight it, and click again to de-highlight it (your browser will remember the path saved in the table as long as you don't clean browser cache for the wiki). once you finally do get through to the other side, pull theleverby the south wall to get to the other side of theportcullis. to the north of you is afurnace. ignore it for the moment. there is also anone wayobstacle pipewhich is a shortcut back towards the start. to the west of you will be a narrow corridor. approach the hallway carefully, as there are five traps, two to the north and then three more in the south wall. these are theodd markingson the wall. the same traps are also referred in the stone tablet to the north, after the obstacle pipe. a saviour who once sat upon his father's glorious throne. there are two ways of passing the traps. thesurgeability is disabled while you're in the pass, so it may not be used to bypass any kind of traps. also, do not try to disable a trap while you're running past it, or else you'll stop and be rapidly hit for every tick that you're in front of the trap. whichever way you choose, you will eventually reach an area with a large and sinister-lookingwellin the middle, with aold journalbeside it and achaos altar. the stone tablet reveals that ""if a light should break the night, the dark will rise to win the fight"". if you are running low on food supplies, this is a good opportunity to activate therapid healorrapid renewal, and wait for your life points to regenerate, then pray at the chaos altar. there are four different paths branching off from this room. for theflat rockpressure plate traps found ahead, it is possible to run straight through if you want to risk setting it off and tank the damage; you will not always be hit. damage received can be anywhere from 1 to 1,000, which depends on your current amount of life points. if you want to pass safely, a plank can be used to cross these traps undamaged. now that you have all four of the orbs, back track a little bit. go back to where the furnace was, remembering to be careful of the traps in the wall. use each of the orbs on the furnace to destroy them. you will now be able to climb down the well. when you are ready, climb down the well. using the plank to bypass the traps. the log trap. the well to the second level of the underground pass. you will find yourself beside three crates; search the middle one to get two salmon and two meat pies. there is also rope respawn spot nearby. head further down the cave and you'll find yourself surrounded bycagesofslaves. following the passage ahead leads to a dead end, so you must find another way to move forward. pick the lock on the southeastern-most cage. you'll notice that there's a rather odd looking patch ofmudat the back of it. dig through the mud and find a hidden tunnel that will take you through to the other side. edge across the narrowledge, and you'll be near a maze of raised wooden bridges. failing to cross the ledge will cause 50 damage. you'll have to make your way back to cross it through the slave's cage again. if you have level 50thieving, you can use the shortcut a little bit farther south, preventing any chance of falling onto the traps. this is recommended if you want to complete the achievementdriven, undergroundineasy tirannwn achievementsnow. there's acagethat you can pick the lock of that allows you to completely bypasses the whole maze. you just have to be careful to avoid the places that are bubbling and do not cross it. standing on the swamp or waiting too long on a non-bubbling region will fall in the place same as failing to cross at the old spike in early section. you will have to redo all the steps if you fall. if you do not have the required thieving level, you need to get through via thewooden bridges. if you fail, you need to climb back up one of the ramps nearby, often setting you back a few steps. to get through the maze: either way, go south and pass-through theobstacle pipeto get into the next area. you can now drop your bow and arrows (if not relying on ranging for combat), ropes, and any damp cloth you picked up earlier. they are not needed for further sections. in this next area you'll find aunicornin acage. search the cage and you'll find a loosepiece of railing. head south down the path leading to where the cage is and you'll find a largeboulder. use the loose railing as leverage to push down the boulder, which will kill the unicorn. now go back down and retrieve theunicorn hornby searching thesmashed cage. the railing can be safely discarded after that. head north past the cage, pass through thetunneland go along the passage past the zombies. you'll come to a small group of paladins who have made a sort of camp in a corner. they're all level 81, namedsir carl,sir jerro, andsir harry. if you talk to sir jerro, he'll give you two loaves ofbread, twomeat pies, a bowl ofstew, aprayer potion (2)andattack potion (2). unfortunately for them, you need thepaladin's badgesthat they carry, to proceed, and the only way to get those is to murder them (they respawn). the paladins can be safe-spotted by trapping them behind the nearby rocks. once you have all three badges (red, blue, and green) head a bit west, keeping your eyes out for the flat rock traps there. again, you can foil them by placing the plank on them, or disarming them, followed quickly by running over them. keep going west to another well. when you search thewell, it reads ""feed me three crests of the blessed and the creature's remains"". use the three badges and the unicorn horn on the well to unlock the largedoors. the final part of the quest takes place in an expansive cavern. this is widely considered to be the most frustrating part of the quest. around the edges of the vast space is a rock ledge to walk on. the mid is a large, open area with a maze of walkways, most of which are permanently broken. if you try to jump across them, sometimes you will fall and end up taking large damage when you hit the ground beneath, as well as being in a large area filled with thesoulless. even though it may be tempting, don't eat or throw away food to free up backpack space unless you have no other option. hastily eating any kind of obtained food will increase your chances of dying from a fall. while there is no minimum requirement, players with lower agility levels will struggle to cross the broken paths. regardless, it is still possible to complete all of the obstacles, even at level 1, with a little luck. the only mechanic that has been confirmed to affect success when attempting obstacles is a higher agility level. before attempting to cross, be aware of the following: for now, ignore the walkway, though do take note of the locations where you can get onto them. head as far south as you can. when you reach the south wall, go a little west, and there will be somecave stairsin the wall. when you walk down them, koftik will appear, ranting insanely before disappearing again. before he goes, though, he'll mention some dwarves that have taken up residence there, and are the only ones immune to lord iban's power. walk a bit to the west to the opening of a fenced area, inside there are three dwarves namedniloof,klank, andkamen. kamen will give you some food and ask you if you want some of his brew, when you talk to him. if you decline his brew, he will sell you a loaf ofbread,stew, and ameat piefor 75 coins. if you accept his offer of a drink, it will cause the agility level temporarily decreases by 3, and he will then still offer the food for 75 coins. you can also heal using theregenerateability and killing the soulless to build up the adrenaline needed. talk to niloof to find out about a witch namedkardia, who knows how to revive iban. once he's told you that, climb up the staircase again and head north-east until you get to the southern most of the many walkways from the ledge. walk across it to the south platform to reach kardia's house. if you fall, just go south of the room full of soulless. search herwindownear thedoor, and you'll hear her muttering to herself about her missingcat. do not attempt to open the door or the witch will take 900+ life points off of you. you can avoid being hurt by clicking away and not continuing the conversation. to find the cat, head north, then west to hop across thebridgegap, then take the northern branch of the path. continue along it, until you reach a platform. once you are at the platform, look at your minimap. head towards the yellow dot and pick up the cat. once you have the cat in your backpack, return to the witch's house. do not drop the cat or it will run away and hide. if this happens, just wait around for a while and it will reappear at the same location where you first found it. use the cat on the door. you'll automatically hide behind the corner while the witch gets her cat. while she's distracted, sneak into her house and search thechest. you'll get arestore potion, asuper attack potion, thehistory of iban, and adoll of iban. if you lose the book or fail to get it due to a full backpack, the dwarf niloof can also give it to you. reading the book, written by kardia herself, provides you with information on iban and how to resurrect him. you need to kill iban by exactly the same way he was resurrected: collecting four elements of his life, flesh, blood, shadow and conscience, and imbuing them with his effigy. only when this is done, can you finally kill him, ending his control. you may drop the book to save backpack space, since it is not required for completion of this quest and only serves an informative purpose. once the book and doll are found, the remaining four steps may be completed in any order. considering the running involved here and with the demons nearby, it is suggested to fight them first and recover the shadow. however, having a lower agility level may cause you to fall from the breaks in the walkway, wherein getting the items from the dwarf camp can be completed first instead. if you die at any point while preparing the doll, you can talk toniloof, who will return it to you complete as it was before death, so you won't have to do everything again. to getiban's shadow, you need to kill three level 78 demons nameddoomion,othainian, andholthion, who are the keepers of iban's shadow, summoned by kardia with a dark, powerful ritual known asincantia. head north of the witch's house and take the first left, and at the next platform head south all the way down until you reach where the demons are. keep in mind that doing this requires the successful crossing of many consecutive bridges, a feat that, if your luck runs out, will take a toll on your life points. it is recommended to take advantage of kamen's 75-coin meals to conserve your own food if this becomes a problem. when you get there, you can safespot them by standing on the bridges connecting the areas they stand and using ranged or magic on them, all while not taking any damage. kill each demon any way you like and pick up theamulet of doomion,amulet of othainian, andamulet of holthionthat they drop respectively. once you have all three of them, head north of where doomion was to reach achest. opening it will destroy the amulets of each keeper and give you iban's shadow. use it on the doll. go back to the dwarves and talk to klank. make sure he gives youklank's gauntlets. next, grab abucketfrom the large building and go into the smaller one. use the bucket on thebarrelinside to get some of thedwarf brewthat kamen was giving you earlier. take this and head to the far south-east corner of the area, where thetombof iban is located. dump the bucket of alcohol on top of the tomb and light it up. after you're done watching it burn, a pile ofiban's asheswill be left behind in your backpack. if your backpack is full, make room and search thescorched tombto find the ashes. use them on the doll. searching the tomb before lighting it, with or without the gauntlets, will result in iban shouting ""leave me be!"" and using a spell which can deal 100+ damage. head straight north from iban's tomb and keep going past all of the soulless until you reach a corridor full ofblessed spiders. walk to the end of the enclosed area to find a giant spider namedkalrag. this venomous spider fed on iban's body, draining it of blood, so she must be killed in order to smear his blood upon the doll. when you defeat her, you'll automatically soak up the blood with your doll. you may want to run, as some of the spiders nearby will immediately attack you withranged. head to the northwestern-most corner of the area and go up thecave stairs, where you'll find yourself in an area with numerous cagedhalf-soulless. to imbue iban's spirit into the doll, you need to find the dove that was murdered by kardia - representing iban's innocent conscience that was corrupted by evil. the dove sat ""inside an old wooden cage"". with yourklank's gauntletsequipped, start from the north-west corner of the area where you entered, near the maze of walkways. head south along the western wall. you will pass two bridges. the third bridge will have a gap that needs to be jumped over. there will be severalcageswithhalf-soullessin them.iban's doveis located in the group ofcagesin the centre of the area, specifically the one centre platform whose elevation is lower than the others. the half-soulless will bite at you and deal 100 damage each time you search a cage. if you're not wearing klank's gauntlets, the bites will cause some more damage. use the skeletal dove on the doll. after successfully creating iban's effigy, complete with the elements of his existence, you'll need to make your way to iban's temple at the heart of his lair. the world map shows the location of the broken bridges. if you happen to fall, the path with the fewest broken bridges from the edge is located on the west side - the second from the north, near the caged soulless where the dove's corpse was found. once you're near the temple, kill adisciple of ibanto getzamorak robe outfit, consists of azamorak robe topand azamorak robe bottom. should you die attempting to dispose of the doll, you will have to run through the entirety of the dungeon again, so be sure to bring the items required with you. while wearing both upper and lower zamorak robes, the players should make sure all other equipment unequipped, otherwise you're not able to enter the temple. therefore just place all your armour, necklaces, amulets or gloves, including klank's gauntlets, etc. in the backpack. any items you drop outside will be lost. you may still enter with an aura activated. having three spaces in the backpack will allow you to collect the runes that will be dropped on iban's destruction. the next part can be tricky to get through for low-levelled players, though you don't have to actually fight iban. what you need to do is use the doll on thewellin the centre of the temple. what makes it hard is that iban will detect the doll in your possession and start launching spells at you. numerous bolts of blood-red lightning all at the same time, causing 100+ life points of damage on impact, and knocking you back to the entrance of underground path.protect from magicdoes not evade any damage from iban's spells. it is recommended to try to move as close to iban as possible, as he casts fewer spikes in his vicinity. try to time it so that you run when there are no magical spikes. if you are a higher level and have decent defence, simply running to the well is possible, without waiting. you may have to do this a few times, as his attacks may interrupt you. once you're ready to throw the doll, go through the door. when you do manage to get the doll into the well, though, iban will be destroyed and the temple will begin to collapse. right after throwing the doll in the well, you will automatically receiveiban's staff, 15death runes, and 30fire runes, and be teleported out. if you do not have free backpack space, the runes will be dropped. you'll find yourself in a cavern where you find koftik, who'll appear to be sane again now that he isn't under iban's control anymore. leave the cavern totirannwn, and koftik will lead you back to the entrance. go back to ardougne castle, and talk toking lathasto complete the quest. underground pass is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

(20 batteries each by repeating the collection). this method should take around an hour or less. a pretty detailed guide for obtaining the batteries for shadow anchors can be found here:pylonfc rs forums vault of shadows. information gathered in previous kharid-et mysteries and research has alluded to the presence of a vault at thekharid-et dig sitehidden within the shadow realm, possibly several layers into the shadow realm. in order to access this vault, four buttons (found asinactive dialsbefore they are powered) located around the site must be activated with the use of spell scroll artefacts. the buttons may be activated and pressed in any order – the order of the subsequent puzzles is fixed in sequence, even if the buttons are activated or solved in a different order to below. upon activation of buttons, you can use the buttons alternative to theshadow anchors, or activatedpylonsto enterpraetoriumand the vault. if the player does not have the archaeology level required to restore one of the spell scrolls specified, a loaned version of that spell scroll may be received fromdr nabanikto use in place of the restored artefact, which will suffice for completing the quest. if doing this, a restored spell scroll will need to be given to dr nabanik to later receive the archaeology experience reward from the archaeology mystery. enter the prison block of kharid-et dig site either via the western door in the main fortress, or by using thefort entranceshortcut. once in the prison block, enter the eastern door. thetime servedmystery must be completed to unlock the eastern door. once inside, theinactive dialis located on the middle of the western wall; south of the corridor, just outside the southernmost room. cast an'incite fear' spell scroll, orloaned 'incite fear' spell scroll, while standing next to the dial. press theice buttonto teleport to the western puzzle room of the vault. pass thepontifex barrierto enter thechapelat the south-east of the main fortress. theinactive dialis located on the northern wall in the chapel. cast an'exsanguinate' spell scroll, orloaned 'exsanguinate' spell scroll, while standing next to the dial. press theblood buttonto teleport to the southern puzzle room of the vault. go to theculinarum excavation sitein the north-east part of the main fortress. theinactive dialis located on the western wall next to the oven. cast the'smoke cloud' spell scroll, orloaned 'smoke cloud' spell scroll, while standing next to the dial. press thesmoke buttonto teleport to the eastern puzzle room of the vault. after activating all the shadow anchors, or the pylons is activated, enterpraetorium war tableto the praetorium. theinactive dialis in the small room furthest west, on the western wall. cast the'animate dead' spell scroll, orloaned 'animate dead' spell scroll, while standing next to the dial. press theshadow buttonto teleport to the northern puzzle room of the vault. head back to the ice button's location (or whichever button you activated first). press the button and enter the vault. pick up thepraetor's log page 1from the floor. it will note that the code for the vault is the same sequence as with the prison door in theprison breakmystery: shadow dials first (top row), then blood dials (second row), then smoke dials (third row), and finally ice dials (bottom row). there are some controls on the floor that will move the coloured dials on the door. the controls each correspond to a different cluster of 4 dials (in a 2x2 square) on the door, and rotating the controls will rotate these dials (clockwise or anticlockwise). the controls are orientated roughly in correspondence with the dials they control when facing the door - the controls nearest the door will affect dials on the top 2 rows (with the left-most control affecting the left-most 2x2 dials in these two rows, the centre control the most-central 2x2 dials on these rows, and the right-most control the right-most 2x2 dials on these rows), the controls farthest from the door affecting the bottom 2 rows (in the same fashion) and the middle controls affecting the 2 most central rows (in the same fashion again). follow the steps detailed below to adjust the dials in the correct configuration. should you make an error, leaving and returning will reset the puzzle. when you solve the puzzle, the door will open and you will findpraetor's log page 2. leave the vault from the button where you entered the vault. the second puzzle located past the blood dial, and is a similar puzzle to the first, but this time the player has five buttons in an x formation instead of nine. the controls each rotate the dials in 2x2 square as before. again the final order of dials from top to bottom is 'shadow', 'blood', 'smoke', 'ice'. to solve the puzzle do the following. should you make an error, leaving and returning will reset the puzzle. however, if you know where you went wrong, it may be helpful to reverse your steps. (for example if it says bottom right back, middle back, top left forward and you moved bottom right forward instead of back and then did the other two, you can go top left back, middle forward, bottom right back, and then resume the guide starting with another bottom right back) changing worlds or going to lobby will put you back in the chapel. when you solve the puzzle, the door will open andpraetor's log page 3will appear in your backpack. leave the vault from the button where you entered the vault. go to the area north of the chapel and cast the ""smoke cloud"" spell to the button on the west wall. in this puzzle, the buttons are in a line horizontally (when facing the door). when moving columns of dials, the buttons in a vertical row will move. the solution is the same. should you make an error, leaving and returning will reset the puzzle. changing worlds or going to lobby will put you back in the chapel. using the boat will take you out by the river and put you on the bank of the river, opposite the dominion tower. the sequence to open the door is as follows. see the image to the right for the button numbering used. backward movements are denoted with a b after the number, eg. 5b is 5 dial back. when you solve the puzzle, the door will open andpraetor's log page 4is placed in your backpack. leave the vault from the button where you entered the vault. the final puzzle is accessed from the shadow dial in thepraetorium(refer to the first part of this guide, ""shadow anchors or pylon"", for details on how to gain access). the solution for the puzzle is, once again, the same. there are five buttons corresponding with three different shapes of dials (each moving four dials at a time): the puzzle may be solved with the actions as follows. see the image to the right for the button numbering used. note that the quest will not complete until you ""talk to"" dr. nabanik. selecting ""mysteries"" will complete the mystery, but not the quest. congratulations, quest complete!  the vault of shadows is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

was released on14 december2020. that's where you come in. her mum and dad fear that she might not be accepted, so they need your help in making her trip the most magical adventure it can be. it's a puzzle quest, but with a twist. you need to get violet from a-to-b, but getting there alone isn’t quite enough – this needs to be a magical journal that violet will cherish forever. to begin the quest, talk tovioletat the base ofwhite wolf mountainon thetaverleyside. to be precise, if you're struggling to find her, you may start from thetaverley lodestone, go south for a very short distance. then start walking up the mountain to the west, and walk past a few wolves. finally you will see violet standing in front of a blue glowing portal. accept the prompt. after doing so, violet enters theland of snow portalto the north. follow her inside and you'll enter theland of snow. at the other side, you'll be greeted by violet throwing a snowball at you, knocking you over. violet challenges you to come and get her at the top of the hill, but there's a challenge – giant snowballs are rolling down and you have to navigate your way around them to reach the top (surgeor similar abilities cannot be used). if you're hit by a snowball, you are returned to the bottom of the hill and must try to make it to the top again. if you get hit by a snowball five times while trying to go up the hill, you are given the option to make them roll down the hill slower, making it significantly easier to reach the top. after a while, the snowballs will stop rolling down the hill completely. once at the top of the hill, talk to violet again, who runs away after a roar from an unknown creature. you are transported to the grounds of a lodge. knock on the door to the north and then attempt to break the door down or knock again. give any response to the creature and then it'll let you into the lodge. inside are twoyetis,bettyandtrevor. speak to them, and they reveal they've just made stew – to which you quickly assume that they captured and cooked violet. violet comes out of the other room to your relief, and betty and trevor thank you for bringing her home safe. violet explains that she just wants to go to a festival, and betty informs her that it's too far away and too dangerous. you explain that you could help her go to the festival, and the yetis request to speak to you alone, leaving her to go to her room. accuse the yetis of capturing violet, and they explain that she is an orphan and was raised by them ever since she was found at their doorstep. they are worried about bringing her to the festival, where she would not be accepted by the other yetis. agree to help them and they will ask you to relay their good news to violet, who is in her room to the north-west. speak to violet to help her pack for the trip, who will then play a game of i-spy with you. you will need to find 5 items for violet, where you are given a certain letter which corresponds to the first letter of the item. these items are randomly generated for individual players and can be found in her wardrobe, toy box, or under her bed. note that some letters may represent more than one item. each letter matches to an object. when you've found 5 items for violet, speak to her again and she will tell you to speak to betty and trevor again. go back in the other room and speak to one of them and trevor will explain that he'll come with you as he knows the route well. exit back through the front door to go on an adventure. a cutscene will ensue where you, trevor, and violet will leave the confines of the lodge and make your way down the path. after the cutscene, speak to violet and you'll remark that the path only seems to go towards a dark area to the north. violet explains that she doesn't like the dark, so you agree to find a way to light up the path ahead for her. investigate the frozen bucket to the west to pick it up, receiving anempty bucketand then investigate the nearby maple trees twice to receive somemaple logs. investigate the maple logs in your inventory and you'll note that you could craft it into a spile that could allow you to obtain maple syrup from one of the trees you just chopped. choose to craft the logs, and you'll receive aspile. go back to a maple tree and investigate it to add the spile, then investigate the ""maple tree with spile"" again to receive abucket of syrup. speak to trevor and ask if he has anything useful, he will give you an empty jar. shake one of the many bushes in the area, which will spawn a few glowing fireflies near it, which can then be caught. with a firefly in your possession, head back to violet's side, speak to her, and you will tell violet to hold the firefly so that its light can brighten the way for violet. however, violet will be amazed at how shiny the firefly is, and proceed to eat the firefly without a second thought, remarking that it was delicious, to your dismay. you then chastise violet for eating it, to which violet responds that fireflies taste like popping candy and give her a warm feeling in her tummy. you realise that giving violet a firefly to hold onto is not the wisest of ideas, and thus formulate a new plan. walk north through the path that goes towards the dark area and check the leaning trees as you go, noting that they appear to be a great spot to place makeshift lights to light the way. however, you would need to find a way to attract the fireflies to them, and for that, you need syrup. the syrup has to be applied to each of the four trees, upon which you should head back to violet to inform her of the new plan. before that, however, you need to obtain anempty jar, which trevor just so happens to have on him. with the jar in hand, you can finally set to work catching fireflies and putting them in the jar. with 10 fireflies in the jar, you are finally ready to reveal your plan to violet, which is to have her let out the fireflies as you run through the path so that the fireflies will fly to the syrup-covered trees, giving you light to see the way as you proceed. at the end of the path there will be 15 headlessice golemsrunning around. violet will insist on helping them, so gather some icy snow from behind her to form heads for the golems. violet will suggest faces to place on the snow heads, either happy, sad, laughing, or angry. match her expression until you've got enough heads and then click on the golems to throw the heads to them. once you finish making heads, there is no limit how many she could throw, so spam clicking here works. once all 15 golems have heads, talk to violet again and she'll be happy. continue on your way to the village. you will come across an ice-covered lake. unfortunately the ice won't be strong enough to support your weight and there is no alternate path. violet will roar at the lake, causing snow from the nearby trees to fall and solidify, strengthening the ice. you will suggest to trevor that by knocking more snow from the trees, it'll become strong enough to cross safely. trevor agrees and prepares to roar, but you stop him. as this is violet's adventure, she should be the one to roar. violet needs something to roar at. there are three melted snowmen nearby, which can be rebuilt with 25 snowballs for the body, a carrot for the nose, a top hat for the head, seven coal for the face, and two branches for the arms. top hats and carrots can be found from the abandoned crates to the west. sets of branches can be obtained by pruning trees to the south-west. snowballs can be obtained from the piles of snow to the south. coal can be found in the abandoned crate to the south-east. once the snowman is rebuilt (this will reward 24 construction experience), talk to violet to point it out to her. she'll walk over to the snowman and roar at it, knocking it over and knocking snow off the trees. repeat this three times to strengthen the ice enough to cross. continue heading northwards. you will now come across an ice maze. head east to find an interactive icy water. reach into the water to find a barrel. speak to violet and she will climb into the barrel to start the puzzle. the objective of the puzzle is to navigate the barrel into the other end of the maze. gaps in the ice and rocks and debris on the ice stop the player and violet before them, but the piles of compacted snow make them stop on them. if you are stuck during the puzzle, you may use the right-click ""reset puzzle"" option on violet's barrel. the solution is to push violet along the yellow path while following the blue path yourself. you've almost reached yeti town – it's just at the bottom of the hill. however, the slope is too steep to walk down and violet is worried that the yeti children won't want to be friends with her, so you must help her build a sled. investigate the placeholder model of the sled in the open space to initiate dialogue with violet. there are several materials you must gather to build it: add the items to the sled by investigating the ""open space"" multiple times. talk to violet again, who wants to give the sled a name. she can't think of one, so she will ask you to choose for her (several of the names are pop culture references). violet will accept any name you pick from the list. after picking the name a cutscene will play. as you and trevor walk into yeti town and violet sleds in, the camera pans and shows various yetis gathered around a bonfire, eventually showing thesnowcone sellerand the yeti children around him. the children admire violet's sled, compliment her hair, and compete to be friends with her, making violet extremely happy. congratulations, quest complete! violet is blue is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:

get there has been stolen. she proceeds to give you clues that you need to solve to locate the map. you need to search locations in the house that matches violet's clues. upon searching a correct location, violet gives the next clue. the clues and locations to search are the following: after you have searched thebarrel of fish,violetwill find coal and a carrot instead of her map. she will then talk about the snowman king who must have stolen it from her. exit the house and talk to violet. she will ask you to close your eyes and not peek. you will hear different noises and you will be given the option to peek or keep your eyes closed. once violet is finished, you will open your eyes to see two talking snowmen standing by the gate. violet, armoured with a bucket on her head, will ""attack"" the snowmen revealing them assnow imps. talk to either of the snow imps to ask them about the missingnamed snow impto find that they never found him after playing ""hide and don't peek"" in an abandoned farm nearby about two weeks ago. go down the path away from the house to the south with violet to reach the farm. open thechestin the southern fenced-in area to find the missing snow imp. after reassuring the snow imp by telling that he's been rescued before christmas, a bang is heard fromyeti town, and the trio goes to investigate. partly due to thenamed snow imphaving been stuck in

christmas. the snow imp suggests to ask the assistants nearby for suggestions on how to help. you must help each of the three assistants, and can choose the order in which you do it. helping each assistant is covered by the following sections. talk toassistant brad(the snow imp in the north-eastern part of the town centre), who tells that he was on christmas tree duty. after asking how you can help, he will suggest that you go totayloron thechristmas tree farmto get a new tree. go north past the bridge, then west to the farm, and talk to the yeti taylor. she will letvioletchoose a christmas tree. in the western part of the tree farm, up on the mound, inspect thewonky tree. violet will pick this tree, and taylor will cut it down and put it in the centre of town for you. talk to assistant brad again to complete this task. talk toassistant susi(the snow imp in the south-eastern part of the town centre) who suggests you to decorate the town. you'll need to gather 4 piles of christmas

escapedvoid pest. during the search, a dangerous plot by a seemingly unrelated enemy is discovered. to begin, travel to thevoid knights' outpostby speaking to thesquireon theport sarimpier. once there, talk tocommodore tyrin the north-east building. after finishing an argument withcaptain korasi, he tells you that thevoid knightsandtemple knightshave made no progress towards catching the escaped pest from theprevious quest. tyr proposes to send you, captain korasi andjessikato track down the escaped pest. talk to captain korasi, who asks you to meet her at the port sarim dock. make your way to the south of port sarim dock, and speak with captain korasi. with no leads on the pest's whereabouts, she asks you to speak to the locals and find out if anyone has seen anything out of the ordinary. speak tocaptain tobiasnearby (be sure to right click and select 'talk to'), who mentions that he hasn't noticed anything strange, but the fishmonger,gerrant, claims that something has been damaging his fish barrels lately. head over togerrant's fishy business, just north of the lodestone, and speak with its owner. gerrant reiterates what tobias said, although adding that the creature headed out west a couple of days back. exit the shop and a purple track appears, leading from the dock and continuing onward to the barrels. follow the track, searching bushes, plants, and stones in the shown order, until you find a mound against the north side ofthe rusty anchorpub. check the mound, then go and inform captain korasi of your findings. she will tell you to go talk to thebartenderof the rusty anchor pub to gain access to his cellar. if you ask captain korasi about the void knights' beliefs, she will hand you avoid knight book. the bartender is, unfortunately, too sick and has lost thecellar keysomewhere in the pub. he mentions looking in one of the junk piles on the floor. search them until you find the key and proceed to the cellar, via the trapdoor in the north-west corner of the pub. in the cellar, you are joined by jessika and captain korasi, who asks you both to look around for anything out of the ordinary. inspect the suspicious-looking wall on the north side and mine it out. a strange purple goo, similar to the one in the trail you just followed, begins to pour out. jessika tells you she'd like to gather some up for further inspection although she needs a container to collect the goo. the nearby storeroom houses an empty barrel which you can use, but you must find a way to obtain it through the beer hatch. once the barrels are in position, kick the empty barrel along the path directed in the picture. the directions and numbers are based on the image above. in the picture, the compass and camera are facing so that north is to the left. for example, pushing barrel #1 to the south would make it closer to barrel #3, while west would make it closer to #7. you can click on the steps to highlight them and keep track. after jessika has collected the samples needed, captain korasi instructs you to talk to the bartender and explain their business in the cellar. you can choose to be honest or lie. **this is the first in a series of moral choices you will have to make across this quest and its sequel. your choices will determinethe type of armouryou receive as areward at the end of the quest series, but the outcomes in the quests’ story are unaffected.** talk to captain korasi at the docks, who says that the pest would probably have stowed away again tomusa pointin search of a warmer habitat. travel tokaramjaand talk tozamboin the pub about noticing anything odd. he mentions thatkofi, the manager of the general store, recently became ill after he saw a scorpion or 'something'. go speak to kofi and he will promise to help you if you can repair his wall. in the south-west corner of the store, ""take-from"" the supply table to get somelogs, aplank, achiseland ahammer. use the plank and logs on the chisel to get ajointed plankandjointed log. use the constructed items together to get ajoist, which you must place on the north wall to repair it. talk to kofi again and he will point you to the pest's trail, similar to the one you saw inport sarim. search the logs, shrubs, and succulents to follow the trail. at the end of the track, you will come across another hidden burrow in the banana plantation. you are joined by the women who suggest you search the hole for more clues. investigate the mound again to get somewood shards, which jessika identifies aswaxwood. she tells you to meet up withrommikat hiscrafting storeinrimmingtonwhile they go see the chemist about the goo. before travelling to rimmington, make sure you have at least 16 free inventory spaces and the waxwood shards still in your inventory. head over to rimmington and speak with rommik, who can be found in the western most of the three south houses,  about the waxwood. apparently, he recently delivered a large order of boxes made of the water-proof waxwood to an unknown buyer infalador. if you misclick or logout after giving the sample to rommik, you will have to return to musa point where jessika will give you more. after learning about the waxwood, go to thechemist's houseto the west and speak with captain korasi and then with thechemist. he requires you to help him analyse the purple goo with different reagents in his laboratory. this entails a short chemistry minigame. the player must maintain the machine's stability while the analysis (done by the chemist) progresses from 0 to 100 percent. there are three things the player must do to maintain stability: maintaining the heat and power levels is simple, but it must be done quickly: maintaining the correct sample is more complicated, but straightforward once the player understands the mechanics: the analysis can be easy to fail and may require several attempts to complete. here are some tips which may help struggling players: after completing the puzzle, speak to the chemist. he reveals that the goo drains life energy from its surroundings to feed itself. on this news, jessika offers to teleport you tosir tiffy cashieninfalador parkto discuss the matters with the temple knights. speak with sir tiffy and he will tell you there is a stall-owner,ali tist, who has opened up for business south of the eastern bank and is selling mysteriouspuzzle boxes. head over to ali's shop and buy one box off him and return to sir tiffy. after you try to open the box, sir tiffy, captain korasi, and jessika each take a go at it, but fail. jessika then suggests some complex ways to open it. it does not matter what you choose, so go ahead with any of them. captain korasi will then crack it open with her sword pommel to find more of the goo. return to ali and attempt to find out where he got the boxes, but he flatly refuses. return to sir tiffy, who tells you to speak withsir amik varze, the leader of thewhite knights. he can be found on the2ndfloor[uk]3rdfloor[us], of the west tower inwhite knights' castle, and he will give you awarrantto search tist's stall. with the warrant, question ali until he gives you amysterious clue scroll, saying that the clue was what led him to the mysterious boxes in a cave. return to sir tiffy to begin thetreasure trail, with captain korasi and jessika keeping contact viacommorb. you may read the clue scroll to retrieve the current clue, dig the ground by choosing the ""dig"" option on the scroll, and get the coordinates of where you are currently standing by choosing the ""sextant"" option on the scroll. the first clue is a map, the location of which is south of the wheat field, west of falador, south of taverley and north ofnora t. hagg's house.show on map the clue you receive will read:""south of a city and east of a guild, there wanders a fellow whose path went astray. hand him an onion and give him a wave, if on track for treasure you're wishing to stay.""show on map the third clue reads:""check a crate in the farmhouse west of the falador farming patch.""show on map the new clue reads""splash of red in a holy bed; lies north of its fountain, east of ice mountain. its three closest neighbours have petals of blue; just dig where it's planted to find your next clue.""show on map this is the time to prepare all your potions, food, and armour. there is a safespot available and the knight is very weak tomagic, so it is strongly recommended. it is not necessary to bring the final clue scroll or any treasure hunting equipment, but remember to bring thecommorb.show on map the coordinate clue reads: ""11 degrees, 9 minutes north 17 degrees, 56 minutes east""which is a hatch entrance south of theblack knights' fortress. this is different from the treasure trail coordinate clues; these coordinates do not require the usual equipment. try to enter the hatchway and you will speak with captain korasi and jessika via thecommorb. they will teleport to you to help you out, where jessika also speaks with korasi about joining thevoid knights. the three of you enter the hatchway and appear in a room full of boxes. captain korasi will knock out theknighton guard and kill him. speak with captain korasi and she will try to enter the next room, although theblack knight doorkeeperwill stop her as she does not know the password. to get a hold of the passcode, jessika will summon avoid drone, which you have to plant on the low box near the door. sneak your way over to the low box near the door avoiding contact with the workers walking in and out of the room. plant the bug and wait for a worker to go through the door. pick the void drone up and speak with jessika, who tells you the password. jessika approaches the door and tells the guard the password but, without an identification insignia, she is not allowed in. pickpocket a worker as he is leaving and you will receive theinsignia. knock on the door and speak with the guard. you will say the password and he will ask for your insignia. after trying to trick you with a ""secret handshake,"" you will enter with captain korasi and jessika. you can kill or bind and gag the guard, then speak with captain korasi. enter the next room and either right click ""murder"" on an indentured servant to receive aworkshop key. alternately, search the north-west bench to receive a tool. use this with the north-east bench to receive a piece of metal. with a few more tools, do the same with the other two benches in the south-east and south-west. combine the hook and both pieces of metal into agaff. to the west of the door you will find a key on a shelf. use the hooked pole on this shelf to obtain thekey. if you have a low combat level, you may want to drain your prayer points before entering the final room. use the key on the next door to be faced by a level 77black knight guardianwith 2750 life points, weak to magic, and another level 110 guardian with 1500 life points, weak to melee. captain korasi attacks the one on the east, leaving the western knight for you. the guardian uses only melee, but can hit hard and accurately and has highdefencestats. should you die, yourgravestonewill appear upstairs next to the hatch; you will have to start your fight again. it is recommended to use magic against the black knight guardian, as he is incredibly weak towater spells. he has moderate melee defence and high ranged defence, although both can also be used with sufficiently high-levelled gear. at a decent magic level (50+), one can expect to kill him in seconds with basic abilities. also, if you have completeddesert treasure,ice spellscan be used to stop the guardian's movements, and are highly recommended due to his weakness to water. as he can only hit you within melee distance, this makes it possible to take no damage throughout the fight. if the player has anyprayer pointswhile fighting the knight, he will shout ""en garde!"", ""your energy will fuel my life!"" or ""inzamorak's name!"", drain the player's prayer points and heal himself. when you finish killing the guardian, speak with thevoid leech, which tells you a little about itself. the void pest was caught by the kinshra to harvest the goo, which they planned to wreak havoc over falador using ali tist's boxes. you are given the option to set it free or kill it. either way, captain korasi will teleport you and jessika back to thevoid knights' outpost. speak with commodore tyr, and after a cut-scene, the quest is complete! a void dance is directly required for the following

impending threat of a full-on invasion by thevoid pests. the quest also includes strong enemies and difficult puzzles. all items can be obtained during the quest. to start the quest, speak to captainkorasi, who is atfalador park. she will be happy to see you, and remark how you have managed to infiltrate theblack knights' fortressby wearing nothing but aguard'soutfit - three times. that means that you are the person to go investigate the fortress for clues on the waxwood boxes of leech goo. she will give you a special set of black knight armour:black full helm (bugged),black

the edgeville lodestone, and head west to theblack knights' fortress. equip your black armour (this will need to be worn while fighting, although additional armour can be equipped in the other slots). when you enter, you will be called by an angrycommander colby, who will criticise you for being an hour late. he will teleport you to the black knights' base intaverley dungeon. he will only teleport you once, so if you have to go back for any reason you must go through taverley dungeon. if you are killed in the black knights' base in taverley dungeon before the pest queen is summoned, you will have to travel back there by foot. the base is located deep in the dungeon, with most of the quest taking part in an even more remote set of rooms. if you choose to get back to yourgravestoneinstead of payingdeath, it can take some time.signs of respite(i, ii, iii) may be used to increase your gravestone timer. the west bank in falador can be accessed quickly from the low wall shortcut, allowing for restocking. alternatively, taverley lodestone and bank are near the entrance. talk tocaptain gilroynext to you and he will automatically send you through the big metal door, where a fellow team member has already set up. behind it is a room with some crates. you will see gilroy ordering the otherblack knightto open the door, which will electrocute and kill him. first surprised, gilroy will command you, the recruit, to fix the door, but not to touch it. try to take any crate. you will remark that the label is positioned in a funny way and tell the captain. the crates contain weights and these must be placed in a certain order on the balance scale on the wall for the door to open. gilroy concludes the crates have been sabotaged by someone, thus making every knight kill themselves, since they will get the code all wrong. gilroy will ask you to hand him some weights so that he, with his misthalinian farmer skills, can decide which one is heavier in order to help unlock the door. if you log out or exit to the lobby at any point of this part, you will be teleported to the kinshra base in taverley dungeon upon return, where you can simply open the door near you to return. search the crates and you will find there are blocks in them. you need to fit them into the door's locking mechanism, but the labels on the blocks displaying their weight are incorrect. captain gilroy will tell you that he can determine the blocks' actual weight. take all the blocks out of the crate. they are numbered from 2 to 6. now use two on captain gilroy at a time. he will tell which one is lighter and which one is heavier. you have to find out the correct order of blocks, from lightest to heaviest. keep using pairs of blocks on gilroy until you know the order. arrange them in your inventory from lightest to heaviest. it is advised to use thenotessystem or a piece of paper and note which block is which. the easiest tactic is to first find the block that is lighter than all others. put it apart, and find the lightest block of the remaining ones. put that one apart too, next to the first one, and repeat these steps. you'll end up with the correct order. when you know the order, talk to gilroy and choose the option ""i think i've got it."" now give the weights for each block, starting with the lightest one and working your way up to the heaviest one. for example, if you found the order of blocks is 3, 5, 2, 6, 4, start with block 3, then tell the weight of block 5, and so on. the block labelled 2 weighs 4, 3 weighs 2, 4 weighs 6, 5 weighs 3, and 6 weighs 5. after you've told gilroy the right order, he will tell you to correct the scales on the door. today's password is ""15"". select ""balance scale"" on the wall to the right of the door. the puzzle shows two bars, one below the other, each with a swivel point. blocks must be arranged such that the weight on each bar adds up to 15, and such that for each bar the leverage of the weights on each side of the swivel point (i.e. the distance from the swivel point times the size of the weight) is equal. the correct code is: top: 5-2-4-4, bottom: 2-2-5-6. another possible solution is: top: 3-5-3-4, bottom: 2-2-5-6 prepare for a fight. now open the door and enter the room. you will be ambushed by a group of pests. captain gilroy will fight thedefiler, while the black knight cowers in a corner. you have to fight four: atorcher, abrawler, ashifter, and aspinner. these fight as they do inpest control, except they are much stronger than their levels suggest. consider usingprotect from meleeordeflect meleeto block most damage. if you die during the fight, the bugged black armour will not be dropped on the floor. you will have to collect it from captain korasi again. attack the spinner first. it will rapidly heal the other creatures as long as it is alive. due to the constant teleporting effect of the shifter, players may find it faster or easier to kill it with magic or ranged. after the spinner is killed, finish off the rest as you see fit. keep in mind the shifter should be next as it teleports the other monsters around which can be annoying. the brawler hits unusually high and quickly, at the speed ofthrowing knives. pick up the security blocks the pests dropped. there are four blocks (gilroy gives you one after speaking to him), but one is broken. speak to captain gilroy. he will tell you to fix the block at the forge in a north-west room. unfortunately, the forge has been destroyed and thus must be repaired. exit the room and head north-west until you find the forge. investigate it; you will need alimestone brick, ahammerand a piece ofhard leatherto fix it. gilroy tells you that all items can be found in the base. search the crate in the same room as the forge, in the south-western corner, to get a limestone brick. the hard leather is located in a crate near the jail, in the far east. return to the forge and fix it. (if you are told that the forge is ""tiny and...broken"" when you try to repair it, then go back and speak to gilroy). it will now require some fuel and needs to be lit. a set oflogscan be found in a crate in the kitchen, which is the most north-north-eastern room, and a tinderbox (you can use a tinderbox in your tool belt, also), which is south of the kitchen. fuel the forge and light it with your tinderbox. put the broken block in the forge. you will obtain a fourthsecurity block. head back to the room with captain gilroy and place the four blocks in their holes (the order does not matter) in the western wall. the security door can now be opened. if you log out or teleport before you open the security door, your progress is saved and any enemies you have killed will remain dead. enter the room, click on the control panel on the western wall, and gilroy will remark that, after the first two rooms, he suspects it has been sabotaged as well. select to search it for magical traps. after disarming the trap, open the panel. talk to gilroy again. you need to solve another puzzle. drag the tiles into the panels. you need to make a horizontal line spanning all three panels, but also fill all the empty spaces. once you've completed the puzzle, you can open the door. enter the next room. you will view a cutscene. a portal is discovered, and your true identity is revealed tolord daquarius. reinforcements arrive in the form ofsir tiffy,korasiandjessika, who, thanks to your bugged armour, are able to bypass the security systems. you manage to convince daquarius to join forces. more temple knights, black knights, white knights and void knights teleport in, and the parties agree to unite under the leadership of the player. talk to korasi to receivekorasi's sword. talk tocommodore tyr, then step into the portal, and you will arrive in anunderground temple. another cutscene will start. it reveals thatwizard melville grayzag, jessika's professor at thewizards' tower, is behind the pest manipulations and plans to gain revenge against his enemies (basically everyone) by summoning thepest queen. grayzag is not quite ready and sends a force ofsplattersto attack, forcing a cave-in on the area where the player was standing. you take shelter in a nearby cave. while the others attempt to make a way out, you must play a modified game ofconquestagainst the ai-controlled pest force. you must command your own troops and defeat all enemy units on the battlefield. this game is safe; if you lose, you return to the cave with all your items and can try again. you have a slight advantage, as the pests cannot use commands such as battle cry or regenerate. you will have standard units, but the opponent has special pest troops: the ai has a fair amount of randomness in its play and does not always make what seems to be the best move. one winning strategy against it is to line up your units near the back of the playing field (not advancing toward the enemy) and destroy the enemy units as they close in to fight. another good tactic is to only use high-hitting units such as your champion and knight. you can fight recklessly as they cannot be killed in a single hit, unlike in conquest. if they get low on health you can use regenerate to fully heal them. most pests will go down in two hits of the knight, and nothing can survive two hits from the champion. taking out enemy units faster than they can take out your units will usually result in a win. if the ai is playing well, you can always retreat from the game and start a new one, as the ai may not play well the next time. only a reduced set of commands are available, but these are key to winning: tips: the ai can move two pests and/or attack twice in one turn, while you can only move one of your men and attack once per move. to compensate for this disadvantage, use the chastise command as often as possible (after each cooldown): look for which units are posing the most threat to your champion, and plan to kill one and block the other from moving or attacking on the next turn with chastise. note that commands can cool down during your turn, so a command that isn't cooled down at the beginning of your turn may be available before you end the turn. protect and heal the champion as a priority. analyse the board to see where your champion can be killed on the next move, and retreat out of range if needed. if you happen to log out during the game or back in the cave, you will end up back outside at the portal room and will have to restart the conquest game. once you have defeated the opponent, enter the door at the end of the room. a cutscene will start. the first thing you will notice is thatvallutais not a metaphor, but aguardian of guthixin the form of a giant tortoise.wizard grayzagis very close to summoning thepest queen, and he needs a sacrifice to complete the ritual. he leaves the decision on who to save —korasiorjessika— to you, or else he says he will kill both. if you save jessika, korasi will be slain by the nearbypest drones; if you save korasi, grayzag will kill jessika withsaradomin strike. after killing the one who the player decided to not save, grayzag summons the pest queen from the portal in the middle of the room. korasi or jessika (depending on who you saved) manages to close the portal by exploding the food-goo, badly injuring herself in the process. unfortunately, the pest queen has already managed to climb through. you can ask valluta for assistance but she will respond that she is too weak to do anything. she will, however, answer questions on how to fight the pest queen. make sure this part is completed before you bank/gear up because if you don't, sir tiffy will not be able to teleport you back to the chamber. before continuing, bank and gear up for the battle with the pest queen (you do not have to wear the black knight armour any longer). keep in mind that your primary weapon will bekorasi's sword. in particular, you will need to frequently use itsspecial attack(which requires 60% adrenaline) to prevent the queen's charge attacks, as these cause 4000 life points of damage to you and your archers as well as healing the queen. it is also recommended to bring an off-hand weapon as you will be able to use extra abilities, such asdestroy. if you happen to die during the fight with the pest queen, your gravestone will appear in front of the portal in the black knights' headquarters. this means you can regain your items without risk of combat, but be aware that it can take some time to get to from your respawn point.sir tiffy cashienwill teleport you back directly to the boss portal. therefore, the fastest route back to your gravestone is to teleport to falador and talk to sir tiffy. an even faster route is to make falador your respawn location and then talk to sir tiffy to get back, therefore saving time and runes. if you teleport out of the black knight headquarters,korasi's swordwill disappear; you can get it back by entering thepest queen's chamber and talking to korasi. (if you chose to save jessika earlier, she will have one.) as for fighting the pest queen, she has two styles of attack, melee and magic, which both can hit over 1500. while melee attacking the pest queen, it is advisable to use theprotect from meleeprayer as that is the more common attack she uses at close range. most importantly, when the queen stops attacking and looks upward, activate the korasi's swordspecial attackto prevent her from activating her own special attack, because she can deal 4000+ damage to you and the knights and archers (which will most likely be killed in one hit) attacking the queen. keeping your lp above her max hit is also advised in case you cannot generate enough adrenaline to stop her special attack with the sword's special attack. equipping a shield to heal from the hit withresonancemay also prove helpful and increase survivability. she will heal herself after she successfully casts the special attack. if you spoke to valluta, you will know that in order to defeat the queen you must defeat her drones. there are a total of ten drones during the fight, which are summoned in 4 waves. four drones will be summoned in the first wave, three in the second, two in the third, and one in the fourth. you must rely on the void archers that enter the room periodically to defeat these drones, as you cannot directly attack the drones yourself. players with high combat will not necessarily have to survive all four waves of drones; the queen may be defeated as early as the first wave. in order to prevent the archers from dying, be sure to either distract or kill the level 130elite defilerswhen they spawn, as they will attack the archers otherwise, and can hit them for over 350 damage. distracting them and tanking their attacks is recommended as their damage to you is more of a nuisance than a threat; however, their attacks can potentially waste yourresonanceif you are trying to heal off the queen's special attack. trapping them behind the queen or behind the boxes at the entrance of the room takes a bit of time, but is worth the effort as it will eliminate the possibility of wasting your resonance and taking unnecessary damage from the queen's special. a maximum of two defilers will be in the arena at any given time, so they will not be a threat if they are trapped in the first room behind the boxes. a good way to do this is to bring a bow and bronze arrows; you will be able to force the defilers to move closer to you while dealing minimal damage. you can stand behind the pillars next to the valluta to lure them closer. after you have killed the pest queen, her body explodes and all knights cheer. speak to jessika, korasi or valluta and a cut scene will play. grayzag has been captured and is tied to a pillar. valluta explains that she is aguardian of guthixand could've easily handled the pest queen if it weren't for her powers being drained by the food goo. she also explains that anyone who battles for balance is valluta, including you. due to grayzag's long-lasting experiments, the dimensional barrier has been permanently weakened, which means the pest invasions will not stop and the void knights must continue their vigil still. at that point daquarius grows sick of the good-talk and approaches to kill grayzag, but is stopped by tiffy. the various orders of knights cannot agree on what to do with grayzag and start arguing until korasi or jessika interrupts them, after which they leave the decision up to you. you will choose one of four fates: with the decision, the knight order alliance is broken and tiffy and daquarius leave (the latter warning not to mess with his business again). tyr heartily thanks you and recounts on the ethics of various decisions you've made throughout the quests, all of which you will defend, and give you elite void knight gear depending on those decisions. congratulations, quest complete! the void stares back is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

seeming alarmed, he tells you that the watchtower cannot currently protect the city from the aggressive southern ogres, as thepower crystalsthat hold the power to ward off the creatures have been stolen. offer to help, and he'll suggest you investigate the area around the tower for clues. due to you taking part in the ongoing investigation, the wizards will now allow the watchtower guards to let you climb up the ladder. you should take thelit candlefrom theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us]of the watchtower, if you did not bring a light source. search the bushes that are a stark contrast from the others, until you find somefingernails. other items obtained include anold robe, adamaged dagger,unusual armourand atattered eye patch, though these items have no apparent use and are not necessary for the quest. go back inside the watchtower and show the gathered items to the wizard. examining the nails, he deduces that they are from a race of humanoids known asskavids, who live in dark caves and serve the ogres. the wizard asks you to retrieve the power crystals from the skavids, and mentions that you should first obtain a map of the skavid caves; their masters, the ogres, might be in possession of one. you need to now gain access to the ogre city,gu'tanoth, to obtain a map for the skavid caves. to enter, you need to help three ogres –og,grewandtoban– in exchange for pieces of anogre relic, which you must give to gu'tanoth's gate guards to prove that you're a friend to the ogres. head north-west from the yanille lodestone to find a tribe of ogres. talk toogto learn that his nemesis,toban, has stolen abar of goldfrom him; if you agree to help, og gives you a key to toban's chest. only the gold bar from toban's chest will work; you still need a separate gold bar for later on in the quest. but before you head to toban, stop by at grew's island. south ofog's tribe, you should see an island with an ogre tribe on it. find a long-branched tree on the west side of the lake and use a rope on the long branch. talk togrew, who tells you to teach his enemy,gorad, a lesson by knocking one of histeethout. take somejangerberrieswhile you're at it as you'll need them later in the quest. take two in case you accidentally eat one. toban's island is between yanille andfeldip hills, but the only way to reach it is via thetunnelsouth-west of gu'tanoth. if you do not have a death rune, a death rune spawns in the south-western part of thefeldip hills(directly south of the tunnel). the wolves and ogres around that area are aggressive, though. head to the tunnel entrance and go through it to reach the island. once there, unlock the chest and take thegold. on the island, you can also find a level 53 chieftain namedgorad; tell him that you have come to knock out his teeth. when he attacks you, kill him to get atoothas proof forgrew. finally, speak to toban, who agrees to barter thethird pieceof therelicfor somedragon bones. use the dragon bones on toban to give them to him.before leaving, grab theropethat spawns on the island, as you need another one to get back to grew. trade the tooth with grew for thesecond pieceof the relic, as well as apower crystal, and the gold with og for thefirst pieceof the relic. if you lose this crystal at any point you can return and get a new one from grew. once you have all three parts of theogre relic, take them to thewatchtower wizardto get them assembled. by now, grew will have already given you the first crystal. keep it safely in your bank or inventory until you finish the quest. you do not need to use the crystals until near the very end of the quest. after you have the full relic, head south to gu'tanoth and walk over to the guards (on the western side) on the path into the city.usethe ogre relic on one of the guards at the westernmost gate to gain access to the city. if you try to talk to the guards or enter gu'tanoth without giving the guards the relic they will hit you for an amount of your life points and knock you down the hill. once you're inside, go a bit south and then east into the market, which is the central area of the city. find a stall in the southern market with food on it, marked withon the map, then steal 1-2rock cakes– an extra in case you accidentally eat one. if anogre traderattacks you, talk to the guards first and then come back to retry. go back on the main path and follow it south to find two more guards. they will ask for some food from the market before they let you across the bridge. give them yourrock cake. continue onward until you find two more guards. all of the chests along the way only have a single level 50 spider inside. try to jump over the hole in the bridge, and when you try, the guards will stop you. pay them 20 coins to jump the hole in the bridge. you need at least 25 agility to do this; if you do not have the requirements, the ogre guards will say, ""come back when you've got the moves!"" when on the next platform, do not open the chest, as it contains a poisonous spider. you will find several city guards. if you talk to them, they'll give you a word puzzle. the answer to the puzzle is ""death rune"". give one of the guards the death rune and he will give you askavid map. theskavid cavesare a series of caves located beneath the ogre city. you need theskavid mapand alight sourceto get in. first, enter the cave on the eastern border of the city(4), and talk to thescared skavid. promise not to hurt him, and he will teach you the basics of the skavid language. then, enter the rest of the caves, all outside the city fence, starting from north(1, 2, 3, 5)and talk to each of theskavids(see below). if it says that they understood you, then you can move on to the next cave. first go to the cave(1)directly north of the summoning obelisk. pick twocave nightshadesfrom the plants in the room before you leave, as you will need them later on. you need your gloves equipped to do this; attempting to pick the nightshade without gloves equipped will result in you taking a small amount of poison damage. then head south-east along the path until you reach the second cave(2). head east to the third cave(3). head south then to the last cave(5). after you've done all of them, go back to the cave(4)with thescared skavid. the skavid will tell you that you're ready to take on themad skavids. go south of the entrance to thescared skavidcave until you reach a gate. talk to one of the ogre guards and then use agold baron them, and you will be allowed through. if you try to go through the gate or give them the gold before first talking to them, then they will literally throw you out of the city, doing a small amount of damage. enter the cave(6)and talk to themad skavid. he will then give you the second crystal and remark that the others are kept by the shamans in theogre enclave. enter the nearby hole to end up back in yanille. return to the watchtower wizard for advice. he will explain that you can distract the enclave guards using cave nightshades. note: although theenclavecontainsblue dragons, none of them are aggressive. however, thegreater demonis, and lower-levelled players should quickly run past it. go to the ogre marketplace and use the cave nightshade on one of theenclave guardsto distract them, while entering theogre enclave. make sure to continue through the whole conversation after using the nightshade on the guard, or else it will not work. after entering the enclave, you'll see a short cutscene where an unfortunate dragon is killed by an ogre shaman. run past the monsters and exit the enclave from the opposite side of the cave entrance. do not attack or talk to theogre shamans, as this will cause them to retaliate with a powerful magic spell, dealing 2000–4500 points of unblockable damage. exit the enclave and return to the watchtower. talk to thewatchtower wizard, who tells you that you must make a potion to destroy the shamans. you will only need one potion for this. to make the potion, add aclean guamto avial of waterto create aguam potion (unf). add somejangerberriesto get avial of jangerberries and guam. grind one set ofbat bonesand add theground bat bonesto finish thepotion. give the mixture to the watchtower wizard to enchant it into amagic ogre potion. doing any of these steps out of order will cause the potion to explode. return to the ogre marketplace in gu'tanoth and use the secondcave nightshadeto distract the guards again, and then enter the cave. just like the first time, make sure to continue through the whole conversation after using the nightshade on the guard. use the potion on the sixogre shamansto defeat them all; do not attack them or you'll lose a lot of health. killing the last will give you the third crystal. the shamans do not respawn after being killed. if you lose this crystal, you will need to search the old robe on the south-east side of the enclave to recover it. to get the fourth power crystal, find therock of dalgrothon the peninsula extending into the central lake from the western side of the enclave. mine the rock to get the fourth crystal. go to the watchtower and talk to thewatchtower wizard. use the four power crystals on the pillars of the shield generator. place the purple one on the north-eastern pillar, the green one on the south-eastern pillar, the yellow on the south-western pillar, and the blue on the north-western pillar. finally, pull the lever at the west end of the room to fix the machine. congratulations, quest complete! watchtower is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

use the map as a guide. it is suggested to enter the maze from the northwest and follow the red route as it is shorter. the minimap does not allow you to directly path to the dungeon entrance. instead, click the little spiral immediately southeast of the entrance, and then it is a short distance to the entrance. the only aggressive monsters are level 7 giant rats on this route. lower-levelled players should beware of the aggressivezombies(level 12 and 29),giant bats(level 44) andhobgoblins(level 28) in the dungeon. once inside, go to the northeast room with zombies and giant bats, search the crate that is slightly darker than the rest to receivea key. head to the northwest part of the dungeon to find a gnome namedgolrielocked in a room, protecting himself from thehobgoblins. use the key on the gate and then speak to golrie, who is willing to exchange his escape forglarial's pebble, which he refers to as just ""some elven junk"". he will take your key, but it is not required to exit the room. glarial's tombis to the south-east ofbaxtorian falls, however, you will not be able to enter with weapons, armour, or runes, as it is a sacred burial place which is not to be disturbed or tainted by combat equipment. go to a bank – the recommended option would be to use the bank chest at the barbarian outpost – and deposit everything except glarial's pebble. summoning familiars and prayers also cannot be used inside the tomb. low level players may want to bring food as there are aggressive zombies and skeletons inside. go a bit south-east of baxtorian falls to find the entrance to glarial's tombstone – inside a large greystone area. use theglarial's pebbleon it to enter. first, go west and search the chest to receiveglarial's amulet. the amulet is required to enter thewaterfall dungeon, but it will be used up later in the quest, so you should use thedrop trickto obtain another and be able to enter the dungeon after the quest is completed. it can also be re-obtained atmay's quest caravanafter putting 150 quest points into the hub track. you will need the amulet for the questroving elves, along with glarial's pebble. after searching the chest, search glarial's tomb in the southern room to receiveglarial's urn. make sure you have the amulet and urn, and either teleport out or head back up the ladder to exit. go back to almera's house and board thelog raft. you will crash, yet again; walk south to the edge of the island and use your rope on the far away rock on the small island directly to the south, as the current is too strong to swim across. next, use the rope on the dead tree. do not climb the dead tree or use the barrel as you'll end up in the river. when you reach the doors at the waterfall ledge, make sure that you haveglarial's amuleteither in your backpack or equipped, and enter through the door. take the eastern passage, and beware of aggressive level 19skeleton magesand level 58 giantskeletons. search the crate (the northernmost one, with two stacked on top of each other) fora key(a different item from the previous key despite the same name). next, head into the western passage and past the fire giants, and use the key on the couple of doors that follow. past the doors is baxtorian's tomb, where you'll find six pillars, two statues, and thechalice of eternityfloating in the air. use an air rune, a water rune, and an earth rune on each of the six pillars, noted by a burst of smoke for each rune and a message in the chatbox. you need to put all three rune types in each pillar. next, useglarial's amuleton thestatue of glarialand the ground will rise beneath the chalice, but do not take the chalice. use your glarial's urn on the chalice and then take the chalice (if you try to do so before the runes are placed you will be flooded out). you will automatically take the reward from the chalice and finish. however, if your inventory is full, you will need to clear out 5 inventory spaces and use the urn on the chalice again. congratulations, quest complete! waterfall quest is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: final room of waterfall quest after unknown date(edit) final room of waterfall quest after unknown date(edit)"

months he's been getting minimal orders, even from loyal customers likenurmof, who cancelled his pickaxe order from doric. to make matters worse, his sonboric, who finished his studies atkeldagrimand was supposed to be home weeks ago, is nowhere to be seen. when asked, he mentions that his last remaining customer issir amik varze, the leader of thewhite knightsinfalador. you then suggest providing sir amik with the smith's best work, hoping to spread the word to potential buyers. doric accepts. the master smith tells you that he is low on the raw materials, namely high-quality ores, which produce the finest work ever. he would like you to obtain them for him, as he must wait in the hut for his son's return. the ores that he wants are: doric hands you amining sites mapand anore bagfor locating and storing the special ores respectively. the sites that you have to go to are thedwarven mine,rimmington mine, thesouth-westand thesouth-east varrock mining site. visit each of the

will also show him the wizard's diary and broken amulet, which he recognises as thegofannon amulet, known to help in training. now that you have gathered the ores, doric's second request for you is to use them to smith a bronze sword and a bronze dagger as samples for bringing in new orders for sir amik. the weapons must be smithed on the anvil in doric's house as it was ""designed especially for working with this high-quality ore"". withdraw the ores from the bag and use them on the nearby furnace to smelt twohigh-quality bronze bars, which you must use on the anvil to smith ahigh-quality bronze daggerand ahigh-quality bronze sword. once you have created the weapons, show them to doric. the dwarf smith tells you that the weapons require more finish before being presented beforesir amik, hence you must take them toakselin theartisans' workshop. aksel stands at the entrance to the workshop, which is in eastfalador. when you speak to him, he'll comment on the good quality of the weapons and agree to have one of his master smiths finish them. aksel will then hand you thefinished bronze swordanddagger. once they are made, you must show them to sir amik's squire,cerlyn, who'll

himself to be doric's lost sonboric, who seems to have a grudge against his father. sir amik will dismiss both of you and you'll automatically take boric back to doric to resolve his issues. the father and son raise up some sparks when they re-unite, so you must talk to them and try to settle the family feud. to fix their relationship, you will need to help them see eye to eye, by having boric explain to doric why he didn't want to be sent to keldagrim, and doric explain that he was only trying to do what was best for his son. successfully persuade the two to reconcile and they will agree to restart the business together. if you take too long, you'll get a warning and a few dialogues later you'll be forced to stop and start again. if you accidentally back out of this conversation you will have to start from the beginning again. doric tells you that he has planned to restart his business, naming it ""doric & son"" and you as its brand new partner. boric gives you eight

""the stone was clearly not of this world..."" a triumphant scratch of movario's quill tore through the parchment. that was it! after all this time his research was finally bearing fruit! the antiquated surroundings of the temple afforded little warmth, and the only luxury was the lone, guttering candle by which he read. the chill still reached inside, but it did not register for movario as his unyielding research ground on through the days. the congregation murmured in apprehension. the druid continued, ""i, for one, will no longer live in fear: we must act now!"" there was a commotion outside, and soon a red-faced youth ran in, ""another murder...the tracker...he's been found!"" a power grows in the north, and an efficient spy network reports all that transpires to its master. the long, dark fear buried in the back of everyone's mind is starting to grow. that which was once overlooked has now become hard to ignore. for what nefarious purpose are there spies in draynor?
exactly what is movario looking for in the lumbridge swamp caves?
what of the ancient power of the mahjarrat and the dragonkin? has something been missed?
the ancient powers of the gods - where did it come from, and what would happen if a mortal could tap its power? any interested parties should contact radimus erkle for what may prove to be the most challenging experience of their entire career. to begin, talk toradimus erkle, the grand vizier of thelegends' guild(fairy ringblr). he will direct you toivy sophista, a druidess intaverley, who is planning to lead a mission intokaramjain order to establish a new temple dedicated toguthix. he will not reveal any information about the mission, saying it is top secret. he informs you of the pass phrase to say to ivy: ""our friend in common places great faith in totems"". make your way to taverley. ivy is located in a house, west of pikkupstix. speak to her and say the correct phrase. she will reveal that there is no plan to construct a guthixian temple on karamja and radimus was led to believe so in order to protect him. she will send you tothaerisk cemphier, who can be found upstairs. go up the stairs and speak to thaerisk. he confirms that the temple is just a cover story by his organisation,crux eqal, which was made by druids to combat the threat of themahjarrat. thaerisk explains to you that a certain foe,lucien, is trying to achieve the status of a god using thestaff of armadyl, not unlike zamorak. while gathering info, his spies are mysteriously killed, which is keeping them at a major disadvantage. as you are talking to him, twoassassinswill appear and will attempt to kill you. they use range, but aren't much of a threat. kill both of them and speak to thaerisk again. he continues, saying that the crux eqal has allied with thetemple knightsand theguardians of armadylto build a strong base against lucien. enemy spies have been located indraynor village, with a certainmovario, whom thaerisk wants to gather more information about. to do this, he sends you to talk to the varrock librarian,reldo. head to thevarrock libraryand talk to reldo. he seems to have explicit knowledge on movario; movario speaks with a slightkhazardaccent, is interested in traps, housing improvements, and divination - ""one thing 'no-fingers mcgrew' was reported to have said was 'solving the puzzle arms the trap' "". he will then read some of the oldest documents in the archive, in old, barely decipherable languages to obtain movario's location. during your conversation, he says, ""do i look like an expert tracker?"", but suggests using ""some jungle creatures that are able to take a scent and track it down."" he says to ""talk to some sort of jungle hunting expert on the matter."" locate thehunting expert, the most proficient hunter, in thefeldip hunter areainside her hut. ways to get to the hunting expert are teleports tooo'glog lodestone,south feldip hills teleport,aksfairy ringcode or thegnome glidertognormadium avlafrim. there is a guide marker that appears as an i on the map at her location. when you ask her about animals that could be used to track down scents, she tells you to catch abroav, who are famous for their powerful sense of smell. they are, however, extremely hard to catch, but she pinpoints the only location where a trap can be used. also, the bait needed to catch a broav are mushrooms frommorytania, which you will receive from the hunting expert. go to the pit, located west of the hunting expert, and build apitfall trapusing a log and a knife, and finally bait it with somemort myre fungus. stand aside and be patient, and eventually, a wild broav will appear and fall in the trap. dismantle the trap to obtain anunconscious broavin your inventory. bring your latest catch to the expert, who will then agree to train it to track scents for you. as you have obtained a way to track downmovario's scent, you now need an object which belonged to him. earlier, reldo had mentioned movario's khazard accent, so you might be able to find something there that may lead you to him. speak toangorat thebarnearkhazard's fight arenaabout movario, who says that he frequently saw movario lugging his laundry to a house nearby. a few ways to get there are by using thedjpfairy ring code,yanille lodestone,tower of lifeteleport, or anardougne cloak 1or higher. go to the laundry house two buildings north ofangor's bar with an activatedring of charos, and charm thekhazard laundererinto giving you movario'sdirty laundry. alternatively, you can use 5,000 coins to bribe him (you need to have the coins in your inventory to access the bribe option, so you may have to withdraw gold from your money pouch). drop your broav and use the dirty clothes on it. as it can get stuck behind obstacles while following movario's scent, you should move around the obstacle, use the ""call pet"" option in the pet interface, and use the shirt on it again to get it to resume tracking. the broav will eventually lead you to the north-westerly building on thebattlefield, where khazard troops andgnomesare engaged in combat. the door is locked, so climb over the broken wall nearby. call your broav then use the clothes on it again. when you get the messageit seems that the broav has found something interesting with this table, search the table to find a trapdoor leading into a dungeon. enter the trapdoor and go through the passage until you reach the crossroads, after which you need to head north along the curving path. at the end of the path are some stairs. climb down.
there is an old battered door at the south end of the corridor. choosing the option to open the door will not work, as it is locked. search on the door instead to read the sign. look closely at the text ""further access prohibited"". one of the letters is replaced by the symbol of a rune, which is the rune you must use to unlock the door and disarm the first of its two traps. if you use an incorrect rune, the door will fire an unblockable blast spell at you, causing 250 damage to your life points. the colour of the blast spell signifies the rune you should have used on the door—blue for water, red for fire, green for earth, white for air, or purple for mind, though the required rune changes after every incorrect try. after you enter the correct rune, you hear a click. boost your thieving level if necessary, then search the door again and you will find a trap to attempt to disarm. if you fail at your attempt or try to open the door without searching it first, it will cause 350 damage and inflict an 88 damage poison condition. threeelite khazard guardswill also be summoned to attack, and must be killed before attempting to disarm the trap again. using area-of-effect abilities and/or burst or barrage spells from theancient magicksspellbook will make short work of them. once you successfully disarm the trap, you will be able to go through. you cannot enter the base with less than 1 kg weight, so un-equip anyweight-reducing clothingthat you might be wearing. once inside, a message appears notifying you that the floor has slightly sunk under your weight. you find yourself in a large room filled with bookcases, with wires running between them. searching the painting on the east wall reveals a small room with a pile of weights, drawer and a thermometer. no need to do anything here yet. to open the cage door, you need to divert all the power from the electrified gate to the wires, using the bookcases. search the bookshelves until you hear a click. you should search the outer bookcases that have electricity running towards them to disable them. from that bookshelf, follow the wire that faintly pulses to find the next bookshelf to search. repeat until the electric door opens. the process can reset, so keep trying. searching/entering the room with the painting may reset the process. search the stairs once the door is unlocked to disarm a trap. if you do not disarm it, you will be dealt up to 1500 damage points. climb up. you are now in movario's study room. do not take anything from the treasure box; it is a trap, and you will be hit for 500 life points. searching the treasure reveals it to be fake, so don't bother. search the desk to obtainmovario's notes (volume 1). read the notes. pick up thewaste-paper basketnext to the desk and search it to find aruby key. search the bookcase to the west of the waste-paper basket and use the ruby key on it. a set of steps will rise in the north-west corner of the room. climb up the staircase. if you need to boost your thieving level again, do so now. search the bed to remove the covers, revealing a hiddenbed chest. search the bed again to discover some ""gadgetry"" on the bed chest. search the bed chest once more to dismantle the trap (make sure to disarm it fully) and finally use the ruby key on the chest. open and search the chest to obtain astrange key loop,strange key teeth, andmovario's notes (volume 2). read these notes too. do not drop either of the sets of notes after reading; you will need to show them to thaerisk later. now that you have plundered movario's base, you need to leave the area with the obtained items. when you attempt to leave by conventional methods, you find that a magical force is blocking your teleportation matrix. you cannot yet leave from the door in his office (see the last paragraph in this section). therefore, you must now find another way out. go back down to the wire room and search the drawers, in the small east room you had uncovered, to obtainnotes on pressure.look at the thermometer; it should read a number. there is a pile of weights next to the temperature gauge. there are three sizes:1kg,2kg, and5kg.pick out weights equal to the number that is required and place them on the statue found up the stairs in the study room, just north of the stairs. use the weights on the statue. if your weight changed while you were in the room, then you must repeat these steps to get the correct weight. also, if the puzzle isn't working, check to make sure you aren't wearing weight reducing equipment such as theboots of lightness, then un-equip, and try again. after depositing the weights, go through the door in his office. if you succeed, the door will open and you can leave. if you don't, the small circle near the door will countdown from three for each failure. if the counter reaches 0, the door opens and you'll be suffocated by a gas and thrown into a jail room. you will also lose movario's notes and the key teeth and loop, and will need to get them back again; though you don't have to repeat any of the above steps again apart from the tickits puzzle. you can teleport out when you open the door. head back to thaerisk, on the1stfloor[uk]2ndfloor[us]of the house west of pikkupstix in taverley, and show him all the items that you obtained in the base. if you do not have all the notes in your inventory, cemphier will send you back to get more information. he reads the notes and tells you that lucien is reaching closer to a powerful artefact, one that brought magic to gielinor and was touched by the very gods themselves, and that immediate action should be taken. thaerisk now wants you to go tomcgrubor's wood, to meet with theguardians of armadyl.mcgrubor's woodis west ofseers' village lodestone. you will meet the guardians on the north end. head to the building in mcgrubor's wood, and a cutscene will start. lucien's minions are attacking the guardians and you've arrived just right in the middle of the battle. kill all themercenary axemenand attack the lonemercenary mage, who teleports to safety. search the dead mercenaries to find a damaged and bloodiedpendant of lucien, although you choose not to take it. talk to thewounded guardian, who will ask you to findidriain the ""arms of a forester,"" before losing consciousness. go to theseers' villagepub, theforester's arms, walk upstairs, and talk to idria. she reveals that lucien is raising an army of undead heroes in thewildernessto the north; lucien's spy network has infiltrated most ofmisthalin. she then reveals that their plan is to capture a spy in draynor and interrogate him for lucien's exact whereabouts. go tofaladorand talk tosir tiffy cashienin the park. he will send you to thewhite knights' castle. at the castle, you find the three allied organisation leaders—thaerisk,akrisaeand his assistant,silif, andidria—together. they are in the eastern room on theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us], by the jail cell. they agree to put aside their differences and focus on defeating lucien. they will give you ateleorbto put on one of lucien's spies in draynor village. akrisae will offer to teleport you there. indraynor village, you find a few white-robedshady strangersroaming about. thesuspicious outsiderswearing the green robes are too alert for you. plant the teleorb on a stranger. he may also catch you and start fighting you. if so, you can run away until he forgets or else fight him until he teleports away, in which case you must find another one. if you have trouble planting the orb, try usinggloves of silence. return tofaladorafter successfully planting the orb and talk to thaerisk and akrisae. the spy will be teleported into the cell, and the truth serum will be brought in by a druid. acutsceneshows a very clumsy attempt to administer the truth serum, as, despite the presence of adruid bodyguard, the stranger attacks the druid. oops! the serum drops and breaks, and you will have to make another one. speak to thaerisk, and he will ask you to hurry tobettyinport sarimwith asnapdragon seedso that she can enchant it and you can get on with the truth. you can purchase a seed from thaerisk for 100 coins. you can either use theport sarim lodestoneor thaerisk's free teleport to reachport sarim. travel tobetty's magic emporiumshop, taking alantern lens, asnapdragon seed, and 20 coins with you. speak to her about an enriched snapdragon seed, and she says that sunlight must be concentrated on the seed, through a rose-tinted lens. she takes the seed and places it on the counter. talk tobettyto buy apink dyeand use it on the lens to obtain arose-tinted lens. then stand just inside the doorway and use the lens with the counter to expose the seed. finally, search the counter and take theenriched snapdragon seed. if you haven't already got it,bettywill offer to give you a regulartruth serumwhen spoken to. go back tofaladorand talk to thaerisk. he says that the seed must be planted in a specially created patch on the top of the castle; climb up the western stairs to the top and plant the seed in the patch. go talk toidria, who asks you to recruit four heroes to apprehend lucien: additionally, you may activatelunar spellsand usenpc contactto contact the threeslayer masters, since you will need npc contact again in the next section. once you have successfully enrolled everyone, head to the top of the white knights' castle to collect the fully grownenriched snapdragonherb from the patch. once you have the enriched snapdragon, mix it into yourtruth serumto makesuper truth serum. head back to the room with the leaders and open thecupboard. inside you can findpapyrusandcharcoal. now go into the cell and convince the captured spy to drink the serum. use the serum on the captured spy, and you will be given three options. the correct method varies by player, and there is no penalty for choosing an incorrect option. he will reveal his master's identity to you, which you will sketch with your charcoal and papyrus, to get asuspect sketch. give the sketch to idria, who will put uppostersseeking information on the wizard known asdark squall. then she will ask you to recruit four more heroes: the first three can be found at thewarriors' guild. you'll be heading to theblack knights' fortressin the next section, so if you don't have ablack armour setto enter the fortress with, you can instead buy aniron chainbodyandbronze helmwhile still at the warrior's guild. cyrisus may only be contacted via thenpc contactspell. after having done so, be sure to switch back to thestandard spellbook. return and speak toakrisae. he will send you to findsilif, who has gone missing in action whilst following thedark squall, and was last seen entering theblack knights' fortress. with the required items, head to theblack knights' fortressand equip the bronze helm and iron chainbody, or full (elite) black set orblack knight captain's armour. a good way to get there is to use theskull of remembranceand climb down the tower to theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us]. the ladder leading down to the black knight basement the tile on which you need to cast charge orb. better not forget your runes and the standard spellbook! silif in prison talk to silif, who says that he feels very weak. head west to the fork in the path, and take the north path and enter the northern door. search all the desks and wardrobes in the room. you will finddagon'hairobes, another set of elite black armour, astrange teleorb, alobsterand arestore potion. search the key rack on the northern wall for acell key. do not consume the lobster and restore potion; if you accidentally consume the lobster, silif will take any other food item you have in your inventory, although he will not take any potions aside from the restore potion, so be careful not to consume any of it. return tosilif's cell and unlock the door using the key. use the food and potion on silif to recover him. if you have a familiar at this point, dismiss it or silif will not take yourelite black armour. speak to him. he will put on the elite black armour and follow you. return to the northern room and lead silif to the maps on the southern wall, and talk to him. he says that he needs some time to study the maps, and hands you ateleorbto plant on dark squall while he does so. you will succeed, but dark squall recognises you, and he reveals that he is actuallysurok. surok calls on his minions to attack you, at which point, everyone in surok's base becomes aggressive. the best method of escape is to simply teleport out, but if you don't have a teleport, activate protect/deflect magic and run back to safety. in falador, talk to akrisae. he will instruct you to impersonate surok, so that you can infiltrate lucien's base, by wearing his robes. when ready, wear thedagon'hairobes and enter the nearby jail cell. the teleorb you set on surok will be used to imprison him there, and you will be teleported to surok's hideout instead. if you forget something and have to teleport out, you will have to use the tunnels you used before to get to silif. make sure to wear yourdagon'hai robesas well when doing this. after being teleported inside, climb up the ladder in the north-eastern corner and stand in the stone circle in the middle of the room. activate the strange teleorb to be teleported intolucien's campnear thegod wars dungeon. talk to an elite black knight to learn that lucien is recruiting and you should go to the chapel to observe. follow the north-eastern path towards thechapeland climb up theice wall(look for a small stick on the tip of the wall that's adjacent to the chapel). jump across to theledgeon the chapel and walk east. a cutscene will play.lucienemerges from the nearby cave and raises several undead heroes from their graves. lucien then reveals that he is aware of your presence, and that you are not surok. he attacks with magic, which you manage to avoid; the spell strikes two elite black knights instead, destroying them.hazelmere, detecting danger, teleports into battle along with the rest of the fellowship –turael,duradel,mazchna,ghommal,sloane,harrallak, andcyrisus. during theensuing battle, duradel, turael, hazelmere, sloane, cyrisus, and ghommal are all tragically slain by lucien, who then sends his guards to attack you. after the cutscene ends, you'll find yourself on the chapel's ledge; jump to the nearby snow wall and return to falador. you can teleport from the chapel itself, so long as you are not skulled, otherwise, you can avoid the wilderness by backtracking to the stone circle and using the strange teleorb to go back to the black knights' area, or simply using a teleport from the snow wall itself. once back in falador, talk to idria and she will say thatmovariohas been moving. he was last seen at the lumbridge swamps, searching for the fist of guthix. (if she won't talk about movario and instead keeps saying to investigate lucien's base, then unfortunately the game glitched and you must go back and rewatch the cutscene. remember to bring the strange teleorb, a law rune, and a death rune.) your next task is to impersonate surok and glean more information from him. wearing thedagon'hairobe set, go to the tears of guthix cavern, where thelight creaturesare, and make sure to bring asapphire lantern. you will not need any food at this time so deposit them to make space for ingredients for the statues. inside the cavern, talk to movario. he believes that a powerful artefact, thestone of jas, which is synonymous with the ""fist of guthix"" and ""eye of saradomin"", is resting inside the chasm below, but has no viable way to get there. volunteer to go down to the chasm and explore for him. attract a light creature with your sapphire lantern, and with some help from movario, opt to gointo the chasm.  after landing in the chasm, search the nearby skeletons for asilver sickle (b), and sixdruid pouches(the other tools are on thetool beltso you may drop them). use the ""search"" option on two nearby rocks in each northern corner to uncover two smashed braziers. afterwards, use a chisel on the smashed braziers to obtain afire orband anearth orb. similarly, go to the air and water braziers, which are intact, and use the chisel on them to acquire anair orbandwater orb. head south until you reach three skull cavities on the southern wall. for each skull, examine its recessed block and use the respective orb on the block to acquire the corresponding elemental key;air,earthandfire keyshould be obtained. climb up the wall between the fire and earth cavities to reach a fourth skull cavity, which is behind a stone cube. use the water orb on the recessed block to acquire thewater key. for each of the three lower skulls, enter its nose cavity (summoningfamiliars cannot be brought into these cavities, and you cannot have anything equipped in your weapon and shield slot). crawl along the tunnel in each cavity to its end. examine the door there and insert the respective key into the door lock. crawl back through the tunnel and exit the skull. at this point, you must have used all the keys except for the fire key. climb up the walls to the upper skull. use the fire key on the skull's recessed block, and search the stone cube in front of the skull. the recessed block moves to reveal a cave opening in the skull. climb through to enter theancient guthix temple. the guthixian temple is made of a central chamber, consisting of an ancient stone table upon which smaller stone platforms are mounted. also, to the opposite side of the table, is a giant door. leading away from the chamber are multiple forks which lead to eightstatues, each representing an aspect ofrunescape. examining the statue will reveal what it depicts. along the forks,druid spiritscan be found wandering. the giant door seems to be linked to each of the statues. before you begin, if you have a sign of the porter or grace of the elves with porter enabled, disable it, otherwise ingredients will be sent to bank when picking up. use yourdruid poucheson the druid spirits. having anouroboros pouchin yourtool beltwill not utilise your druid pouch charges. they will thank you for releasing them and then drop the ingredients for one of the statues. do not make any potions or eat the toad legs. use the herbs and the secondary ingredients on the statues in any order. for each statue, determine which skill it represents and use the appropriate herb and secondary as listed below. for defence, energy, and strength, you might receive the ingredients for its super-doses variant. after correctly placing the ingredients on the statue of its specific element, you will receive adolmen. once you run out of druid pouches, use the sickle'sbloomability on the vines to receivevine flowers. you can refill the pouch with the flowers, with a set of three making three pouches. do not refill the pouch unless you have at least three flowers, or you may accidentally consume the mort myre fungus secondary ingredient. use the eight dolmens on the platforms on the stone table in the middle of the temple, and the giant door will open. any of the 8 potions may include: energy balance prayer hunting fishing magic defence strength agility restoration attack range combat the dolmens unlocking the door. (click to view) make whatever arrangements necessary to battle a level 117balance elementalthat can use melee, ranged, magic, and lower your combat stats, as well as two level 119tormented demons, capable of using melee, ranged, and magic, hitting up to 1100. the demons will pray against melee, ranged and magic if hit with attacks from these styles, meaning you will need to have at least two combat styles prepared; however, they will not pray against necromancy. you can leave the area to get supplies, but always bring your lit sapphire lantern. proceed down the corridor that was revealed when the huge door was opened. enter a large chamber that contains a mysterious stone on a raised set of platforms. once ready, search the stone. a short cutscene will play, in which the balance elemental materialises. after you defeat the elemental, touch the mysterious stone again. another cutscene will play, in which it is revealed that the mysterious stone is actually thestone of jas. all your combat stats will be boosted up to level 255. after you discover the stone of jas,movarioanddarvewill appear and apparently gloat over their find. talk to movario and go through all the options in order. without the elemental to annihilate him,lucienwill appear, and he will berate them for not informing him of their find. talk to lucien and go through all the chat options as well. movario and darve will teleport away, followed by lucien, who will take the stone of jas with him after summoning twotormented demonsto deal with you.idriaand someguardians of armadylwill teleport in to assist you against the demons. the demons are fairly easy to defeat as you have been imbued with power by the stone of jas, with greatly enhanced stats — you will have level 255 in every combat skill. do not use stat boosting potions such asoverloadsafter receiving the stat enhancement as the potion will override and lower your stats making the fight very difficult. note that despite being boosted by the stone, the demons can still do a lot of damage, so do not underestimate them. you will need at leasttwodifferent non-necromancy combat styles for this battle, as each demon uses prayer and changes its protection prayer based on your attack style. as long as you switch styles at the right moment, you can defeat them fairly quickly. the guardians of armadyl can influence the tormented demons to pray melee, so using ranged or magic is highly advised if not using necromancy. if you leave the battle, your stats will be reset; however, they will return to 255 when you return. use the nearby pillars to block one demon while you're fighting another. if you die to the tormented demons, your grave will appear outside the tears of guthix minigame. after you defeat the tormented demons, talk to idria. she will commend you for your efforts and teleport you to falador, where you must speak to her again to be presented with either of aruined dragon armour lump,ruined dragon armour shardor aruined dragon armour sliceand 5,000 coins from the demons. congratulations, quest complete! when the quest officially concludes, after using of all four 100,000 experience boosts, talk to idria again to view the ""elsewhere..."" epilogue in which you learn about thedragonkin's return. if you need to re-watch the epilogue for themaster quest capeafter completing the quest, you can talk to silif on the east side of the white knights' castle on theground floor[uk]1stfloor[us].   after the quest, new replacement npcs appear since lucien killed most of the team of warriors organised to stop him in the wilderness, although there is no replacement forhazelmereorcyrisus. due to the death of the close friends of your character and heroes ofrunescape, memorial statues were put up at several spots in remembrance of them. when these statues are examined, it reads ""in honour of the hero, [dead hero's name], who died attacking the mahjarrat known as lucien"". two statues of turael and duradel at the entrance of the slayer tower. two memorial statues of ghommal and sloane now flank the entrance to the warriors' guild. all of the memorial statues of the fallen heroes line the sides of the bridge. while guthix sleeps is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

tokeldagrimonce all threats have been dealt with. thorgel has reported strange sightings in the temple and asked for help via a messenger. agree to help arianwyn investigate this report, and begin the quest. arianwyn wants to accompany you to thetemple of lightthis time, in order to examine the pillar where all light rays merge. thanks to your ability to pass through themourner tunnelsin disguise without problem, and the fact that the temple's restored security will allow for elven magic to be performed, arianwyn will be able to enter the temple. your first task is to bring him a disguise in the form of another set ofmourner gear. from there, the plan is to create a diversion in the death guard headquarters to prevent detection when arriving, and bind ablank teleport crystal(which he gives you) in order to teleport directly to the temple. you will need to finish the chant on the prepared crystal by performing crystal singing at the desired location. if you give arianwyn your only set of mourner gear, you will need to slay another mourner withinarandarto obtain a set for yourself. otherwise, you may use your current set to infiltrate the mourner headquarters underwest ardougne, slay a mourner, and obtain the gear that way. continue reading into the next section for additional information. you may choose to give arianwyn your set of mourner gear now or later, though it'll likely be more efficient to wait: regardless of the process you chose above, you will need to end up within the mourner headquarters. the second step in arianwyn's plan is to create a distraction. to accomplish this, your oldgnome friendwill prove useful once more. retrieve atarnished keyfrom thehead mourner's desk to open the gnome's cell. enter the cell (right next to the head mourner's office), and speak with the gnome about getting some help from him. he will suspect that you are not really a mourner. you may either reveal the truth or continue staying undercover. regardless, you will promise him that you will free him in return for his aid, to which he will agree. you may now decide on whether or not to keep your promise. if you wish to keep it, speak to the head mourner in the other room and say that having the gnome around is a security risk, on the grounds that a curious thief or child from the city might sneak inside and discover the mourners' operations. advise to release the gnome as you had promised (in order to remove all risks and tie up loose ends, of course), to which the mourner will eventually agree. you now need to enter the tunnels using the""new key"", which should likely be on yourkey ring. if you don't have it, you can obtain another by again searching the head mourner's desk. add the key to your key ring. finally, run to the west past the dark beasts and enchant the blank teleport crystal in the tunnels near the entrance to the temple of light, just bynissyen edern's dead party. you must remove yourgas maskbefore attempting to enchant the crystal. you may enchant your crystal at any of a number of places just above the dead slaves (see image for example). you must also be sufficiently close to the temple to be able to enchant it. a fine spot is several steps east of the first dead slave. when you use the crystal to teleport here, you likely won't arrive in the exact spot that you chose. when you've found a good spot, chant the crystal and a cutscene begins. apparently your singing isn't appreciated by some folk, as some of the mourners are lead to cry and bang their heads against the wall in an attempt to ""make it stop."" at the end of the cutscene, your character will be satisfied with their singing, and you'll be ready to continue with the quest. return to lletya to talk to arianwyn. give him the extra set of mourner gear (if you haven't already), as well as the enchanted crystal, which he will strengthen. you'll then inform him that the captive gnome inventor will aid you. if you are ready to return to the temple with him, agree to start the operation. while you are able to wear normal armour within the mourner tunnels, you'll have to be wearing your mourner disguise in order to teleport with arianwyn.) you will teleport first to make sure the coast is clear, and arianwyn will follow moments later, armed with acrystal bow. remember to bring or reclaim the crystal trinket (frommourning's end part ii), as it can be incredibly inconvenient to retrieve it if you forget it. you will need to lead arianwyn to thorgel. the elf will be able to kill shadows using his bow, but you should still be cautious. thorgelis by the mysterious ruins that lead to thedeath altar. to get to the death altar through the temple, go up the stairs immediately west of the temple entrance. on the second floor, head south and climb the ladder in the wall cavity down the hall. on the third floor, return to the centre (watch out for a spinning blade trap!) and go down one of the two sets of stairs. descend further and pass through the door of light. arianwyn will not pass directly through the light doors with you, but he'll continue following. the light door here is passable only if the beam of red light from the pillar just beyond the said door it is pointing at the door (if you remembered to point the red light at it during your last visit). after passing the door of light, you'll need to rotate the mirror in the red beam to point towards the pillar next to the death altar door. once that's done, go through the door and talk to thorgel. if you are not able to pass through the light door below the staircase, it is because the red beam is pointing at the pillar next to the death altar door instead. you need to get to the death altar via a different route (via theabyssor awicked hood, or even through the back entrance in theunderground passnear the 3 dwarves). enter through the death altar door from the altar side, redirect the red beam to the door immediately below the staircase, and then finally return with arianwyn to the temple of light. for some players, the wicked hood teleport to death altar will also teleport arianwyn. talk to thorgel, who tells you to speak again with arianwyn. arianwyn wants you to go back and inspect the energised pillar. he postulates that because you've manipulated the light energy with the mirrors you should be fine to full-on touch it. he'll catch up with thorgel while you investigate the energised pillar to the east of you. a loud noise will occur, but it appears to do you no harm. however, you'll find the energy strangely familiar. speak again with arianwyn, and you'll tell him the energy of the pillar reminds you of thecrystal trinket. you'll now need to use the trinket on the pillar. if you do not have the crystal trinket with you, you may speak with arianwyn to obtain one. a bright flash of light appears. return to talk to arianwyn again. you discover the trinket contains the same type of energy as the temple, but is insufficient to absorb the required amount of energy for it is too small. therefore, arianwyn thinks your much bigger body will do the trick, suggesting that you energise yourself like you had done with the trinket by getting onto the death altar and touching the temple's large crystal. thorgel enters the death altar to assist you in climbing onto the altar. if you do not have a death talisman with you, you may speak with arianwyn to obtain one. if you lose this copy, he will not give you another. follow thorgel to the death altar and talk to him. he will help you onto the altar, where you become energised with death energy. this lasts only a short amount of time, so you'll need to be quick for the next steps. arianwyn will not be protecting you, so make sure you are able to withstand the shadows' attacks. once you've touched the crystal, quickly run back down the stairs and touch the energised pillar. if you are still energised, you will be teleported to another location. if you were not quick enough or log out or return to the lobby, you will need to become energised again and repeat the process. make sure you have time available to complete the following portion of the quest, as it is instanced; i.e. if you log out, return to lobby, or die, you'll appear back at the death altar room. the positions of receivers differ from player to player. watch the cutscene when you teleport to the next location, as it contains clues you need for the puzzle. search thedead slavefor a set ofnotesand acolour wheel(if you don't already have one). read the notes, which contain more clues in order to solve the puzzle in this location. a beam ofblue lightshines from the blue light emitter on the east wall, and this is the only light emanating at the start of the puzzle. the wall also has red and green light emitters, which are not functioning. the west wall has a large stone door that must be opened, along with four light receivers. to complete the puzzle, you must use the crystal trees, rotate the crystal cores, and use the colour wheel to guide the light. the key to understanding the colour wheel is to match up colours which are opposite each other on the wheel. for example, on the wheel, yellow is opposite blue, therefore, to ""unlock"" the yellow light receiver you have to use a blue light beam. as a crystal tree is blocking the light blue beam, you must chop it with a hatchet and then shape with a knife to become a crystal core. the blue beam of light must be guided into the yellow light receiver. this activates the red light emitter and the green light receiver. once the blue light shines on the yellow receiver, thered lightemitter will be activated. you will now have to unlock thegreen receiver. combine the red and blue beams of light into a magenta beam and direct it towards the receiver. the red and blue beams do not have to follow theexactsame path to the green receiver as long as they combine into the magenta beam which can then be directed to the receiver.when directing the magenta beam into the green receiver you do not have to keep the blue beam directed at the yellow receiver.once the beam activated the received, the green light emitter will be activated. thered receiveris next. the green and blue beams of light must be combined into a cyan (green + blue) beam and guided towards the receiver. as previously, the green and blue beams will not take exactly the same path to the red receiver but will join up part way to make a cyan beam which is then directed the rest of the way. this activates theblack lightreceiver. all three beams of light must now be guided into the black light receiver (the one that has no colour when examined). when combined the red, green and blue beams will make a white beam. as with the previous steps, the beams will start out along quite different paths but will eventually come together to form a white beam which can be guided into the receiver. this white beam must be directed into the black receiver. this causes a ladder to appear along the south wall. it may be helpful to begin each round by simply aiming each ray of light straight across the room, from east to west. if you die, your grave will appear behind the energised pillar. to get there, teleport to the death altar through theabyssor thewicked hoodif the door to the altar is unlocked. you will have to repeat the energisation process again to re-enter the platform puzzle area, although the light puzzle will stay completed. again, should you leave the game for any reason, this is also where you will reappear. climb the ladder. you will find yourself on one of several wooded platforms. you must jump from platform to platform(by clicking on the gap)until you get to the one with the ballista(see image and solution map). to complicate things, spikes will shoot out from the floor of some platforms in certain spots, damaging about 10% of your current life points every couple seconds you stand on one. it is therefore imperative to time your jumps right. some platforms don't have spikes, and can be used as safe spots. as long as time is taken to carefully complete the puzzle, it can be fairly easily solved without taking any/much damage. even on the platforms which do have spikes it is possible to make your way across without taking damage. the spikes are static (stay in one spot) on some platforms, making it fairly easy to time your jumps and run past the spikes. other platforms have mobile spikes, which circle the platform. wait until the spikes move through the spot you wish to jump across the gap, then jump and ""follow"" the spikes around the platform until you get to your next jumping point. the puzzle can be completed without taking any damage, but it is recommended to bring lots of food just in case. when you reach the platform with the crystal ballista, shoot the ballista at the right time to hit the target. you can take as many tries as you need until the target disappears. this causes the door in the west wall of the previous room below to open. unfortunately, this means that you'll have to navigate back through the maze to get to it.... once you've navigated back through the spiky maze, you are able to go through the open door in the west wall of the light room. search the deadelf messengerin the corridor to find areport. read it to discover thatiestin edernindicates that you are in a 'corridor of light' that (before it partially collapsed) led from the temple to an 'undercity', underprifddinas, which has been reverted to crystal seed form. exit the corridor and return to the death altar via the exit portal in the light puzzle room. talk to thorgel, who tells you that arianwyn has returned to lletya. (this is not required, one can simply teleport back to lletya and find arianwyn without speaking to the dwarf.) now is your last chance to inquire about saving the gnome, if you intend to (it's completely optional). head back to the mourner's hq and talk to thehead mournerabout releasing the gnome. he will consider it. if you return after the quest, the gnome will remark that he overheard the guards considering his release. return to lletya and speak with arianwyn, giving him the report you found. he is amazed that prifddinas has been reverted to a crystal and plans to send thorgel and other dwarves to clear out the corridor of light to the undercity. quest complete! within the light is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"

thesixth age. it has been labelled bymod markas ""the most important one to date"". this is easily explainable, seeing that the outcome of the quest has an immense impact on the world. it is recommended to complete all of the quests required for the optional rewards before starting the quest, because they will help with fully understanding the characters and plot; whilst it can be started and completed without any of the ""prerequisites"", it takes place chronologically after these quests. if the player dies during a battle, the gravestone will be placed outside the temple. it is recommended to start the quest with ranged or magic combat gear because it makes the first fight, which starts shortly after beginning the quest, much easier. this quest can be started by talking toorlando smith, who is excavating west of the legends' guild (fairy codeblr). orlando has stumbled across some ruins to the west of the legends' guild that he believes could save his struggling career at the varrock museum. after the conversation has finished, the door will be opened. enter the ruins with him. orlando will be amazed by the room and asks to find an appropriate artefact to take back to the museum. there are five artefacts in the room: a shattered blade (used by guthix to slayskargaroth), an inactive obelisk (speculated to be an ancient summoning obelisk), stone carvings (suspected to depictfiara,juna, and the extinct race ofnaragi), clouded vials (likely used for early forms ofherblore), and a dusty parchment (not to be confused with the scattered parchment in the middle of the room). inspecting all of the artefacts will trigger the opening of another door, leading to a room containing a guthixian butterfly statue. orlando will attempt to lift it but fails. the player then tries and succeeds, activating an alarm system and opening a new set of doors. upon entering the new room, theautomaton generator,automaton guardian, andautomaton tracerwill activate and demand themahjarratpresence to leave. both orlando and the player attempt to reason with them, and neither succeed. orlando's persistence causes the automatons to attack, killing him. the automatons again demand the mahjarrat presence to leave before attacking the player with melee, magic, and ranged attacks.the automatons use an ability whereby they thump the ground, causing massive shock waves and huge damage that can kill in seconds. do not underestimate this attack.it is advised to use magic or ranged attacks to take them out, focusing on the melee automaton first. this will completely negate the stomping special attack (as long as he is killed quickly enough). alternatively, the melee automaton can be trapped behind an obstacle to prevent all stomping attacks and attacks from him. taking out the ranged automaton after trapping the melee one is preferred. if melee combat is preferred, once the automatons start thumping the ground, run from them to avoid taking damage from the shock waves. it is advisable to turn off auto-retaliate to avoid being brought back to the shock waves by the magic and ranged automatons. right after killing the automatons, back out during dialogue with an ""actually, i have something i need to do first."" this gives time to walk back to a bank to restock and heal before the next fight if needed. after killing the automatons, a shadowy figure will appear, demanding to know who is disturbing guthix. after speaking to him, he will reveal that he is actuallysliske, ask the player to ponder why they were the only one who could open the doors, and reveal that guthix is still downstairs sleeping. a cutscene shows the sword that guthix plunged into the wilderness with his edicts that ended the god wars and which is now transmitting to the stone circles now that the alarm system has been triggered. however, the stone circles are no longer all in guthixian hands.zemouregalreceives news that the stone circle at varrock is active and asks his wizards to trace the source of the signal at once. the gods also know what is happening and are communicating with their followers, the generals in thegod wars dungeon.commander zilyanais shown leaving. the zamorakians and saradominists want to kill guthix and remove his edicts from the world. sliske, however, says he believes, as a follower of zaros, that guthix can be awoken and bargained with. the player, as the central figure, will have to choose where to stand and who to support: the zamorakians and saradominists, the zarosians who wish to awaken him, or the guthixians who will try to protect him. since the player will need to reach guthix, it is suggested to side with the guthixians initially, since they have a better understanding of the place and its defences. kree'arra, zilyana andk'ril tsutsarothwill appear. tsutsaroth storms through the next door into the temple, and zilyana goes after him leaving kree'arra to deal with the player. kree'arra tells the player to leave, saying that killing for no reason is not the way of armadyl, but since he has allied with those wanting to kill guthix, the player refuses and fights him. if the player dies here, the grave will appear at the entrance to the excavation site. kree'arra is significantly easier here than in the god wars dungeon, but there is a complication — tornadoes move around in the room, and if they are on the same square as the player, they will take damage equal to 20% of their maximum life points every game tick. avoid them at all costs, especially the blue tornadoes, while continuing to fight kree'arra. moreover, kree'arra may use his special attack (he will say 'storms align to me!'). when this happens, kree'arra will walk into the centre of the chamber, and all storms will flock to him. it is advised to run away from him since he will release the storms, yet if he is attacked shortly after, the magical storms will be closer to the player, leading to a highly likely death. attacking withrangedis recommended because it gives flexibility to move around the room away from the tornadoes. if the player are willing to attack in this style, it is possible to get kree'arra stuck behind one of the many pillars which allows continuous attacks until he uses his special attack. unlike in the god wars dungeon,meleeattacks can be used. they also work fairly well if the player has agodsword.protect from rangedordeflect rangedis strongly recommended, particularly to avoid the special attack, but the damage from kree'arra can be handled with food (as long as the tornadoes are successfully avoided). once kree'arra is defeated, he will retreat. bank at this point to restock, if necessary; however, any follower will need to be dismissed, preferably before entering. if the follower is not dismissed and the player tries to use the control panel, juna will repeatedly state that the follower needs to be dismissed even after it is dismissed. a cutscene will showcommander zilyanaandk'ril tsutsaroth, unable to open the next door. zilyana tells the player to leave, as she and tsutsaroth go to look for another way in. the room has a puzzle in the middle of it. head to the eastern end of the room and try to operate thecontrol panel; this will be interrupted by members of theguardians of guthixand some of their allies. the player must convince them that they are on the same side, and they accept that the player has a link with guthix since the doors opened previously. the guardians will explain that the walls of the inner sanctum are impenetrable with magic, and they are unable to teleport further, but the control panel may give means of opening the door. the object of the puzzle is to guide a boulder from the currently active corner to the activate destination, a circle with a green dot within the puzzle. first the path from the corner to the destination is constructed, and then the boulder is released to travel along the path. to release each boulder, click on the active corner of the puzzle. the puzzle display is currently bugged for some mac and linux users, displaying only a black screen when activating the control panel. to work around this bug, navigate to settings > camera and change the camera mode to 'classic' with the dropdown menu. to construct the path, start at the active corner and rotate each piece in sequence until it connects properly with another piece. generally there is only one possible connection at each point. to make the boulder travel the path, release it and then release it again each time it stops on a gateway. it will need to be timed right so that it passes through the next part of the path: after the boulder reaches the destination, a new one will activate, and another corner will be active. repeat this process four times, and the gate will open. the solution to the first puzzle. the solution to the second puzzle. the solution to the third puzzle. the solution to the fourth puzzle. after opening the doors, you will come across seven automatons, including an unknown figure. his name is soon discovered to becres, after juna recognises him, an old ally of some of the guardians before the god wars and the fall of the gods. you will be asked to examine the shrine behind cres, which is labelled ""strange map"". upon examining this map, it will present you with a scenario and then ask you how to resolve it. you must get all of the categories to 50% exactly. the four categories are good, evil, order, and chaos. each answer will fill up 2 of the 4 categories by 25%, so carefully read the answers before choosing them. if you go over 50%, you will be declined by guthix and given a chance to try again. when you complete the map, a cutscene will unfold and you will be blessed by guthix. the spectating guardians explain that you are now a guardian of guthix as well. after being blessed by guthix and becoming a guardian of guthix, you must prove your worth physically. rally the troops to battle by using the options in the chat box. they do not directly affect the outcome of the battle, but they do change their chat responses. you will be asked to assign each group of guardians to each of the storage rooms that will soon be attacked. carefully read each of the descriptions and assign them accordingly. if you wrongly assign them, the battles will be enormously more difficult. suggested pairings: if you choose incorrectly, it is possible for fiara and/or thaerisk to die and be replaced outside the quest, much like during while guthix sleeps. before each battle, juna and the druids provide cauldrons of elixirs which provide power and restore health and prayer and removes poison; and you can talk to the druidess to access your bank. if your health or prayer points are boosted above maximum, drinking from the elixirs will reduce them back to maximum. rocktail soups and bonfires can be used alongside super potions to enhance your maximum attack, strength, defence and life points. doing so will make the next battles much easier. it is recommended to use yew logs or better for a bonfire to increase your maximum life points, although if you have a high combat level (120+) you won't need these at all, since the fights shouldn't be that hard for you. it is a good idea to use equipment that will not be lost or degraded upon death if you happen to die, because it can get very expensive for lower levelled players to have to keep recharging and repairing gear. the enhanced excalibur is however recommended as it only cost 500 coins to replace. the correct defenders for this battle are chaeldar and thaerisk this battle is the first, and possibly the easiest of the storage room battles. graardor will attack you with all of the combat styles, but deal the most damage with melee, so it is recommended to pray against it. in addition to the basic attacks, he has three special attacks which he will use at random during the battle: if you are using ranged or magic, there is a safespot from graardor's main melee attack in the south-west and south-east corners. effective:melee works fine. during ""graardor protect!"" just heal yourself. during ""graardor mad!"" run through and behind him. during ""graardor smash!"" click away and clicking back should be enough time to avoid the attack and you can resume. repeat until he surrenders. once you defeat graardor, he will retreat and you will be called onto the next one. the correct defender for this battle is cres this battle can be difficult due to the large amount of damage taken over time, but it should not be a problem for anyone who can deal heavy damage quickly. zemouregal will spawn two blue portals which must be destroyed before he can be damaged. while the portals are active, he will not retaliate if attacked. simply destroy these portals while countering the damage taken from his undead minions. once the blue portals are destroyed, zemouregal will begin attacking with magic attacks. he will also spawn red 'decaying portals' around the area that spawn more zombies. these can be ignored; however, don't stand too close to them as they deal small but constant amounts of magic damage. once the first wave of portals are defeated and you have reduced his health to about 70%, zemouregal will create a stronger wave of four blue portals. repeat the same process as the first wave, and deal as much damage to him as you can while he is recovering. once all the blue portals have been destroyed, you will be able to defeat him. effective:ranged armour works best since there is only magical attack. use actions with recurring damage on zemouregal and those that hit fast on the portals. ricochet is good here.throwing weaponsare perfect. on defeat zemouregal will retreat and you will be summoned to the next storage room for the next battle. the correct defender for this battle is death this is a simple fight of tanking. k'ril will force spikes through the ground that damage you only if you are standing on top of them, so when you get the message in your chatbox, simply move out of the way. it is also worth noting that he can poison you, the same way as in thegod wars dungeon. the damage from the poison is relatively minor, and can usually be ignored, but can be annoying to some. in addition to his standard attacks and poison, he has three special attacks which he will use at random. when he shouts ""you cannot stand against zamorakian might!"", he will slam one of his cleavers into the ground and cause spikes to emerge. they cause heavy damage over time, so it is advisable to dodge this quickly. if he shouts ""run, coward!"", he will charge in the direction he is currently facing. if you move out of the way before he hits you, he will hit a wall front of him and take some damage. beware he will turn his charge in your direction once you have moved. k'ril's most dangerous attack is indicated by him shouting ""guthix will die in the name of zamorak!"". he will follow you around the room at a running pace, attacking very rapidly for heavy amounts of damage per hit. this attack can kill you very quickly if you are not constantly running from him. players who cannot remember all of this may just simply run out of the way when they see k'ril tsutsaroth saying something. effective:magic seems to be most effective against k'ril, however melee may also be used because he will come closer to you anyways. whenever he says something,run awayas if your life depended on it. then go back and hit k'ril and you'll be fine. due to his large size, it is possible to safe-spot k'ril tsutsaroth at the north-east corner of the room. this method also prevents him using his special attacks. when you finish this fight, you will be called for the final storage room battle with enakhra. the correct defenders for this battle are fiara and valluta this fight can be the longest out of the boss fights because enakhra can heal herself by stealing your life points. enakhra heals by the amount of damage she deals to you (before any damage reductions) during her special attacks. before the battle it would be useful to add thefreedomand perhapsanticipationabilities to your action bar. the first half of her life bar she gets zamorak's aid every 15 seconds, so start running at about 13 otherwise it's quite tough if you're around level 100. effective:enakhra is the easiest of them all if encountered correctly. all you need is a weapon with high attack, and food that can heal for a long time. the healing from abunyipworks well, and can eliminate the need for food. you should use ranged attacks,protect from magicordeflect magicif you are usingancient curses. during the battle she will often ask zamorak to heal her and will then start to leech health from you. this will continue until you break the connection with her by running behind any of the obstacles in the room, or by attempting to stun her (this works even though she is immune to stuns). when you get away, enakhra will teleport closer to your location so the battle can continue. it is important to have auto-retaliate turned off during this battle, since it will enable you to break the link by running away. when she gets to 50% health, she will occasionally shout ""not so fast!"" and pin you to the ground to drain you. this works like a stun, and you can escape with the use of thefreedomability, or avoid it by using theanticipationability (you'll get pinned, but won't be stunned, and can walk away to get back up immediately). also, you can avoid it altogether by moving every few seconds, since that is what appears to trigger the pinning, but that option makes the battle last longer if using melee. another good method is to range her, for example with acrystal bow. a lot of people find it easier to hit her with ranged than with melee. bring food and a bunyip if you can, then alternate between attacking and evading her. one click - attack, next click - behind a boulder; that way she will follow you, and you will be able to attack her again without delay. since enakhra's drain will heal her for 10% of your current life points per second, an easy way to beat her is to only bring low-healing food like cabbages into the fight. if you never interrupt her drain, she will not resort to other attacks for the duration of the entire fight, even when her life points reach 50%, only healing up to 22 life points per second, if you only eat one cabbage at a time when extremely low on life points (20 or less), where the drain will only damage you for 1 life point per second. when she is defeated, you will be called back to the main lobby for the next battle without a possibility to bank, so you might want to bring some more food to get your health up again. a way to circumvent enakhra's healing is to use the ""hugging"" technique. this plays around an obstacle in the room that has 2x2 size. to use this technique, the player should always stay beside the obstacle, whenever enakhra starts leeching just run to the other side. after defeating all of the bosses, return to the main room. you must defend juna from attacks by saradomin combatants for about two minutes, without juna losing her health and dying. as the fighters (spiritual warriors, rangers and mages) are only level 49, this is not very difficult—attack each of them to train them on you instead of juna, killing them quickly, until the time is up. alternatively, repair the barriers as the warriors knock them down. if you are having problems attacking them quick enough, multitarget attacks such asancient magickscan hit all the fighters that spawn from one portal thus removing the need to attack each fighter individually. commander zilyana will eventually get to cres. she will stab with a killing blow, thinking she had killed the god of balance in disguise with ease, before being told that she simply killed a guardian. suddenly, thezarosianmahjarrat akthanakos, azzanadra, and wahisietel arrive with char andnex, trapping zilyana. you then have the option of deciding whether to wake guthix and learn from him, leave him to rest, or kill him. regardless of your choice, the tableau will be broken by an unknown person, revealing the pathway to guthix. juna thinks that the zarosian's arrival was just a distraction, but azzanadra says it was not in their plan. zilyana claims that there is nobody else, but the leader of the faction you chose will say that they do not know that, and tell you to go and follow whoever destroyed the tableau, and to try and reach guthix first. getting hit by a spirit ball or fireball damages you for 20% of your maximum life points. it isnotpossible to teleport out of the area. regardless of your decision, upon reaching guthix,sliskewill appear, revealing that he has betrayed you and thezarosiansand then mortally wounds guthix with a powerful spell from thestaff of armadyl. guthix will then tell you to come to him, and he transports you to his own memories of his home world, where he appears as his original mortal self and explains his past, telling you how he found the planetgielinorand brought the races we know today. follow him from place to place, past the dead naragi and the body ofskargarothand eventually you will reach his old house. after telling you of the immense power you now hold to defend against the gods, and after asking you if you will do as he requests, and protect the world from the gods, you have the option of accepting his request, declaring loyalty to another god, or stating your intention to achieve godhood yourself. regardless of your choice, guthix will lay down on his old bed and die, telling you to forget him and to remember your purpose. upon waking from your vision, you will be back next to guthix's petrified body, with the guthixians, zarosians and commander zilyana joining you. juna will ask what happened, and death will tell her that it was the mahjarrat sliske. azzanadra and the other zarosian mahjarrat will be displeased with guthix's death, claiming that it did not have to come to this, although char and nex don't seem to care. juna is displeased, saying that with the edicts broken, another god war will inevitably begin, and you have the option of saying you will stop it, you will support the god of your choice, or you will strive for godhood yourself. eventually, the godsaradominwill appear and teleport the zarosians away, saying that this is no place for battle. saradomin will ask you what you think of him, giving a choice of three options. regardless of your choice, saradomin will attempt to teleport you away, saying that he sees the chamber as a good new headquarters and that you will no doubt meet again. after the teleport spell splashes due to your blessing from guthix, saradomin will be intrigued, asking you what knowledge guthix gave you in his last moments. regardless of the option you choose, saradomin will teleport away, saying that it is an honour to have been blessed, but warning you to be on the right side when the inevitable conflict begins. after saradomin departs, speak to juna again, who initially believes it's all over, but, after encouragement from death, realises that they are still following guthix's plan, and good can come of this. juna will then hand you your rewards, completing the quest. however, you must have 10 free inventory slots in order to get the rewards.  the world wakes is directly required for the following quests/miniquests: image from behind the scenes the

he flatly refuses, so simply empty the potion into thecup of teaon sithik's drawers. go down the ladder and back up to find that sithik has turned into an ogre. talk to sithik, and he confesses to being ah.a.m.member and provides information on the zogres. he had hired vahn to cast the spell to eradicate the ogres, and that it is irreversible. the only way to contain the disease is by containing the afflicted. the undead ogres can be harmed by a special type of arrows – 'brutal', which are made from flat sides of nails – providing powerful crushing power against the zogres and skogres. the cure from the sickness is by using the healing properties ofrogue's purseandsnake weed. obtaining the answers from sithik and speaking to grish unlocks the ability to makebrutal arrows. making these arrows (and the composite bow) yourself is not required to complete the quest, however, you'll only inflict half of the maximum damage when fighting against the final boss using arrows made from any other method. it can be killed with ordinary level 40 weapons, but it will take a while. if you decide to use brutal arrows and the bow, you can save time by purchasing them from thegrand exchange, as obtaining the ingredients can take a substantial amount of time. you can make anogre composite bowafter having grish show you how to make one. it can be made by clicking on anachey tree log, withwolf bonesin your inventory, creating anunstrung comp bow;

it is recommended to use at leaststeel brutal arrows, whilerune brutal arrowswould provide the maximum damage. attacking with melee and magic are more difficult due to slash bash's high defence against everything but brutal arrows. if the fight takes too long, he will stop fighting you and disappear. if not using the ogre bow/brutal arrows method, the fight will be long but easy. your hits will only hit about half or less than normal, but with 60 defence, food is not even required. onceslash bashis dead, pick up the twozogre bones, threeourg bones, and theogre artefacthe drops. return to grish for your reward. zogre flesh eaters is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"
