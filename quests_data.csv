Can you help the professors to rebuild it? Teleport toYanille, then walk north-west to the building north of theobservatory(north ofCastle Wars) and talk to theprofessorin the reception. Bring up the observatory and you'll be informed that the observatory telescope is broken. He explains that the houses up on the hill outside have been occupied by unruly goblins who have caused him nothing but stress. The professor asks for your help, the idea presented by his assistant, in rebuilding the telescope. When you agree, he'll ask you to get some materials for the telescope parts. First, he asks you to provide him with 3 woodenplanksfor the telescope base. He says to talk to his assistant if you need help, but you don't need to in order to continue. Talk to the professor to give him the planks. Next, give him abronze barfor the tube and somemolten glassfor the lens. To make the lens into an exact shape and size, you'll need a lens mould which, unfortunately, the goblins have stolen. Leave the house and head east to one of the abandoned buildings. If you didn't bring an antipoison, there is asuper antipoison (1)respawn in the south-eastern building. Climb down the stairs in the west building to arrive in a maze-like dungeon, which is littered with chests throughout it. One of these chests contains thegoblin kitchen key- its location is random for each player - while the others hold a single dose of anti-poison, a level 15poison spider, or simply nothing. Run to every dead end and search the chests. Go through the dialogue until you find and obtain the kitchen key. Once you do, head to thesleeping guardguarding the kitchen to the north. Prod him awake, and he'll turn into a level 28 goblin guard. You can either kill him or lure him far enough from the gate to get into the kitchen. Inspect thegoblinstove there to find the lens mould, which the goblins were apparently using for cooking. Head back to the professor with the mould and he'll instruct you on making a telescope lens; simply use themolten glasson thelens mould. Talk to the professor again and he will ask you to meet him at the other side of the observatory. Go back down in to the goblin dungeon and follow the path south until you can go up the stairs. Speak to the professor and watch the long cut-scene of him fixing the telescope. Finally, go up the stairs and talk to the professor again, who tells you to have a look through the telescope and note the constellation that you see. Should a player look through the telescope again after the quest is completed, they will see the Scorpio constellation. The Observatory professor will suggest going to see his assistant. Upon speaking to the assistant, who reveals that his name isPatrick, he'll thank you for having made his life easier and give you ajug of wine. He also mentions a book on the nearby table named 'The book of astronomy', which speaks of Scorpius' grave. Travel past the abandoned buildings, and keep going north until you see some level 28 ghosts near the entrance of theOurania runecrafting altar. TheSpirit of Scorpiusis located in this area with the ghosts; after a brief conversation, it will give you an unholy mould and tell you to return when you are worthy. With the mould, a ball of wool and a silver bar, make anunholy symboland return to the grave so that Scorpius can bless it. Observatory Quest is not currently required for any quests or miniquests. "

Due to an oversight during your recruitment, you are now to hunt down an extremely dangerous wizard and mass murderer namedSolus Dellagar. Speak withSir Tiffy CashieninFalador Park. Ask if he has any jobs for you yet. He lets you know theWhite Knightsmade ""a tiny blunder"", and that you're not actually permitted to join theTemple Knightsif you're not in the order of the White Knights. It turns out you have to work as a squire for five years... or try Sir Tiffy's different solution to the problem. Tell him you are interested and he will mention a loophole which will let you in, now ask about the Wanted quest, and he will tell you to go seeSir Amik. Find Sir Amik (2ndfloor[UK]3rdfloor[US]of west tower) and talk to him; after a short conversation, he asks you to become a squire. If you decline his offer; Sir Amik tells you that there needs to be a crisis for you to be deputised directly as a White Knight. If you instead accept his offer; he will ask you to get him anAsgarnian ale. Bringing him one will just cause him to ask for another one. Go report back toSir Tiffywith what Sir Amik said and he will tell you about a particularly vicious and dangerous criminal. After the conversation with Sir Tiffy, head back to Sir Amik and speak with him about the criminal. Sir Amik tells you the news that a criminal namedSolus Dellagar, the ""infamous murderous mage"", is back. Continue through this conversation as well, and accept the mission. Sir Amik now makes you a fully deputised White Knight. Return to Sir Tiffy and speak with him. Your task is to track Dellagar down for a recovery team to capture the evil mage â€“ Tiffy will mention that you need a device called acommorb, which you can either have Tiffy make (by giving him alaw rune,enchanted gem, andmolten glass), or by giving him 10,000coins. Tiffy now asks you to contact your information operative,Savant. You have several options for controlling your commorb: Contact Savant using the commorb, then ask about current assignment. She tells you that you should investigate theTaverley Dungeonwhere theBlack Knightssupposedly are, and that you should also take a look at theMage of Zamorakthat is interested inRunecrafting. Head intoTaverley Dungeon. Make your way to the south-western-most room of the Black Knight's Base to findLord Daquarius. Talk to him, but he won't help you. Savant advises you not to try to bluff him into giving you something. Once you kill aBlack Knight, however, Daquarius will give in, begging you not to kill any more of his men. Talk to him again, and he tells you that Solus is in a place with a lot offurthat is notbear fur. Go straight to theTemple of Zamorakin the southeast corner ofVarrock. Before talking to theMage of Zamorak, take off any worn Saradomin or Guthix items and grab twenty unnotedruneorpure essence. Once you are ready, talk to the mage. The Mage of Zamorak offers to trade what he knows about Solus for yourcommorb, but Savant stops you. He then offers to trade his information for twenty unnoted rune or pure essence. Talk to the mage again, and trade him the essences. He tells you somewhat unhelpfully that Solus is east of the mage.Savantreminds you that Daquarius said Solus is with furry animals of some kind. The adventurer deducesSolus Dellagaris inCanifis. Now head toCanifis. Once you enter the village of werewolves, Savant contacts you and says she is going to scan for Solus. She tells you a bit about a teleporting experiment and suggests you scan for Solus. If you exit out of dialogue upon arriving in Canifis, you will have to return to the Mage of Zamorak and begin the conversation again. Choose the Scan option with yourcommorbas you walk around Canifis until you uncover Solus. Solus briefly appears, speaks with you, and disappears. Savant then appears and gives you a clue to Solus's next whereabouts. From this point on, you'll be chasing Solus throughoutGielinor, and each time you find him you'll receive an item in yourbackpack. That item is a hint for where to go next. There are a total of seven locations that need to be scanned. Each location is random, except for theChampions' Guild,Oziach's Armour, and theRune Essence mine, which are always the third, fifth, and last locations, respectively. Listed below are some items that you may receive during your pursuit of Solus, along with the location the item is a hint for: These items always appear in a predetermined order. These items appear in a random order, and vary from player to player. Solus will also react based on which scan location out of seven you are currently at. After defeating the Black Knight at the sixth scan location, you will receive 20 notedruneorpure essence. This will point you to theRune Essence Mine, so head there using whichever method you prefer. Upon entering the mine, you view acutscenewhere Savant summons fifteenrangersto attack butSolus Dellagarkills them all withIce Barrage, dealing 700 damage to eachTemple Knight. After that, the cut-scene ends, and Solus is greatly weakened. Finish off Solus Dellagar yourself. Solus is fairly easy, with no specific combat level, around 3500 life points, and only uses melee due to being weakened. Once he is defeated, you receive hishatin your backpack. Return to Falador, talk toSir Amik Varze, and hand over Solus's hat. If the hat is lost, speak to Savant to obtain another one. Wanted! is directly required for the following quests/miniquests:"
